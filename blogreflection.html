<ol>
  <li>Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
Pros:
    <ul>
      <li>Computing helps us become more informed with news that we may not know from commmunicating with other people</li>
      <li>Computers have a very efficient way to organize and store data like photos, notes from class and important files so that it is still easy to access yet kept in a safe space</li>
      <li>Computing helps improve quality of life to help make our lives easier and more efficient like copy and paste, where rather than typing the same thing over and over again you can use ctrl-c and ctrl-v to do the same thing in a shorter amount of time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Computers can cause people to spend too much time sitting down and looking at a screen. This can have bad long term affects on ones eyesight and physical health. It can also effect a person’s social life because they can become addicted to a screen.</li>
  <li>Not all computing technology is used to good intentions, like how the military may use their access to technology to hack into another country’s server</li>
  <li>There is a digital divide, where people who may not be able to afford electronics may feel disconnected and left out from opportunities from people who have access to technology</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
I use my computer for many reasons: school, homework, extracurriculars, communicating with peers, etc. Sometimes when I lose track of time, I spend the whole day in front of a computer screen, either being productive or wasting time. I could either have a lot of homework that needs to be done or I could be bingewatching my favorite show. Because the computer gives me access to almost let me do anything I want, I can easily get distracted from a Youtube video or online shopping, which can cause me to procrasinate. Yet again, my computer is also used for productivity, where I can do my research for my English paper or go on Khan Academy to learn a new skill to further develop my knowledge on my academics.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="ctp-questions">
<a class="anchor" href="#ctp-questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CTP Questions</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit
    <ul>
      <li>Helps people make an informed decision about what type of car they are looking to buy. Users can gain specific information on the type, model, mileage, and price of a car.</li>
      <li>Helps people save time when buying a car. Instead of having to spend hours going from car dealer to car dealer asking questions about a car, the user can find all the information they need in one place on one website.</li>
      <li>Since our project has a sign up and log in feature, this means that users can “save” cars their account and refer beck to them by logging in to the website again. This feature makes looking for information easy and fast.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think of a potential harmful effect of your project.
I think that our website could potentially be a disruptor in how people look for a car to buy. Instead of seeing the car in person, the user might base their purchase only on what they see online but when they actually get the car, it isn’t what they were anticipating. This can create some false expectations which wouldn’t be good for someone trying to make an important purchase.</p>
  </li>
  <li>What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others.
Its obviously very upsetting that digital divide is something that exists. I think its very unfair that not everyone has access to the same opportunities and education, something that is partially effected by the digital divide. Those who do not have computers lose access to the internet and all the information that comes with it. As a result, they fall behind other, not because they lack the skill, but because they lack the resources which is extremely unfair.
Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school?
Pros	Cons
prevents students from getting distracted (ex: games, youtube, instagram etc.).
could block websites and videos that are actually informational and needed during classroom work-time
This creates a bias against what should and should not be filtered. Some content that is actually purposeful and informational might get blocked just because of it’s source which is considered “bad”
students don’t have access to good internet which can impair the quality of learning</li>
</ol>

I chose C, The expression (num MOD 2) will compute the remainder when num is divided by 2. This code fragment will display “odd” when num is even, which is the opposite of its intended behavior.</p>

<h1 id="q12">
<a class="anchor" href="#q12" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q12</h1>

I chose “(onFloor1 AND callTo2) AND (onFloor2 AND callTo1)” but the answer was “(onFloor1 OR callTo2) AND (onFloor2 AND callTo1)”
Notes
I overlooked the fact that there were two answers that were the same, the only difference being that one was AND and the other OR. In both the ways that the answer calls the function, the elevator will be able to move which is why the correct answer is “OR”</p>

<h1 id="q26">
<a class="anchor" href="#q26" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q26</h1>
<p><img src="https://github.com/sarahliu2006/Sarah-Liu/blob/2f8c6efb93dba9b0d71a821cbdae441bfd14f845/images/q26.PNG?raw=true">
I picked D, which had the robot in the center of the grid facing up. Although this is a possible location for the robot to end up in, it wasn’t facing in the correct direction. The robot should have been facing downward. Therefore, the correct answer is A, which has the robot in the center of the 5th row on the grid, facing to the left.</p>

<h1 id="q27">
<a class="anchor" href="#q27" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q27</h1>
<p><img src="https://github.com/sarahliu2006/Sarah-Liu/blob/2f8c6efb93dba9b0d71a821cbdae441bfd14f845/images/q27.PNG?raw=true">
I had chosen option C.This algorithm is wrong, however. This is because the function get messed up since the n = n+1 is set at the beginning, therefore, the “repeat n times” function will mess the code up from the beginning. Therefore, option D is correct because it sets the n = n+1 at the end of the algorithm.</p>

<h1 id="q28">
<a class="anchor" href="#q28" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q28</h1>
<p><img src="https://github.com/sarahliu2006/Sarah-Liu/blob/2f8c6efb93dba9b0d71a821cbdae441bfd14f845/images/q28.PNG?raw=true">
I selected answer B which was wrong because with each iteration of the Repeat 4 times loop, the robot will move two squares to the left and will remain facing up. On the third iteration of this loop, the robot will attempt to move to a square that is beyond the edge of the grid. At this point, the robot will stay in the lower-left square and the program will then stop. That is not supposed to happen. Therefore, the answers are A and C, both of which correctly execute what needed to be done. For A, each iteration of the Repeat 4 times loop, allows the robot to move one square to the left and one square up and will remain facing up. After four of these iterations, the robot will finish in the gray square. For C, after one iteration of the Repeat 2 times loop, the robot will end up in the upper-right square facing to the left. After the second iteration of the Repeat 2 times loop, the robot will end up in the upper-left square facing down. Both od these result in the robot ending in the gray square.</p>

<h1 id="q30">
<a class="anchor" href="#q30" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q30</h1>

For this one, I selected only one answer because I read the question wrong. It asked for 2 answers. I don’t know why I selected A which drew the circle before anything was defined in the program. I think that was a silly error on my part. I was probably getting confused with answer choice C which defined different numbers to x y and r.</p>

<h1 id="program-purpose-and-function">
<a class="anchor" href="#program-purpose-and-function" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Program Purpose and Function</h1>
<p>In my video, I will demonstrate filling out the multiple choice questionnaire (input). Once I hit submit, it will show the output, which will be the model name (and possibly an image) of the best fit chevrolet car for the user.</p>

<p>Written Response:</p>

<p>Function: A questionnarie on a website which recommends a chevrolet vehicle that would best match with a user’s transportational needs</p>

<p>Purpose: To help people who are trying to buy a new car find the chevrolet car model which best meets their needs. This helps people save time when they’re trying to buy a new car, and also to be prepared when they visit the dealership.</p>

<p>Input: user answering car search tool questionnaire on frontend</p>

<p>Output: car recommendation</p>

<h1 id="data-abstraction">
<a class="anchor" href="#data-abstraction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Abstraction</h1>
<p>Code segment which shows that data is being stored in a list: create array with quiz questions and iterate through them</p>

<p>Code segment which shows the data in the same list being used as a part of fulfilling the program’s purpose: loop through questions –&gt; if user’s answer marches with a product’s assigned answer –&gt; add one point to that car model, just like a quiz assigning points to a student</p>

<p>Identify name of variable representing list being used: TBD</p>

<p>Describes what the data contained in this list is representing in the program: the data contained in the list will be the questions that the users will be asked and the answer sets that go along with them to determine which chevrolet car recommendation they’ll get</p>

<h1 id="managing-complexity">
<a class="anchor" href="#managing-complexity" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Managing Complexity</h1>
<p>Explains how the list manages complexity, how the program would be different without the use of the list, and why I need it for my program: If I use a list to store the data for questions and the user’s answers, it will be easier for the program to come up with a result for the car recommendation by adding up points for each car and then choosing the car which is the best fit for them
Procedural Abstraction
Code segment that shows a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure: Create function that adds points to the cars which match with the user’s input –&gt; whichever car has the most points will be printed as the best fit match –&gt; works like a graded quiz, kind of</p>

<p>Show a code segment where the student-develop procedure is being called: show a place where my quiz point adder will be called</p>

<p>Describes what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program: The procedure essentially finds the car in the list which is the best match for the user. Without the procedure, the program would not be able to find a best fit car for the user</p>

<h1 id="algorithm-implementation">
<a class="anchor" href="#algorithm-implementation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Algorithm Implementation</h1>
<p>Code segment in student-developed procedure shows sequencing, iteration, and selection</p>

<p>Explain in detail steps how the identified algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it: explain each step of the algorithm</p>

<h1 id="testing">
<a class="anchor" href="#testing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testing</h1>
<p>One call to program</p>

<p>Question: “What type of car do you prefer”
User Input: “Sedan”
Condition: If loop, if user chooses “sedan,” add one point to all the variables for cars which are sedans
Output: The car which is outputted will be a sedan
Second call to program</p>

<p>Question: “What power source do you prefer”
User Input: “Hybrid”
Condition: If loop, if user chooses “hybrid,” add one point to all the variables for cars which are hybrid
Output: The car which is outputted will be a hybrid sedan, using both of these calls to come up with the final result</p>
