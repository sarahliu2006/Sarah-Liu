- Diplays the importance of collaboration in coding inside the classroom, and outside the classroom
    - Super Mario Brothers 2&3
        - Shigeru Miyamoto and Kensuke Tanabe first created Super Mario Brothers 2 to have levels in the game where they would either go vertically or horizontally, but never both at the same time

    - Leave comments in code
        - Partner
        - Youself
