## 1.1 Daily Video 1
- Diplays the importance of collaboration in coding inside the classroom, and outside the classroom
    - Super Mario Brothers 2&3
        - Shigeru Miyamoto and Kensuke Tanabe first created Super Mario Brothers 2 to have levels in the game where they would either go vertically or horizontally, but never both at the same time
        - Super Mario Brothers 3 is where Miyamoto = director and Tanabe = level designer, merged the vertical and horizontal concept into one screen
        - Exemplifies how collaborating brings in diverse ideas and combines them into one unique idea
- Skills learned through collaboration
    - Communication
    - Consensus building
    - Conflict resolution
    - Negotiation

## 1.1 Daily Video 2
- Shows examples of ways to collaborate in the AP CSP classroom
    - Pair Programming: Two people collaborate where one person is the driver (writes the code) and the other person is the observer, who looks at the driver's code and helps revises it if they see an error
    - Think-Pair-Share: Students think of an idea alone, then come together to talk and compare their solutions
    - Leave comments in code
        - Partner
        - Youself
        - Acknowledge code segments and media from other sources 




Program Function and Purpose Quiz 3/3

- DISPLAY –> “print()”
- if statement commonly used when comparing one variable to another ex. (if x > y)
- arrow –> “=” in code
- initialize variable to #
- REPEAT UNTIL serves as “for loop”
- functions with multiple parameters

## 4.1-4.2 Daily Videos Notes

- computers used to be big and isolated –> computers now capable of sending & recieving data (binary)
- packet: small amount of data sent over computer system, can be sent in any order and assembled in recipient's device
- a message is broken into packets –> packets can be recieved in any order and still be reassembled by the recipient’s device
- primary uses for the use of open protocols on the internet: provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices.
- The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files that is accessed via a network called the Internet.
- look through each test case–> evaluate line of reasoning!!!
