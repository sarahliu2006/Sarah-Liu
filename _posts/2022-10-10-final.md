## Program Purpose and Function
Our Programs function is to help people with different illnesses identify their sickness by entering various symptoms that we are pulling from a health API

## Data Abstraction
There will most likely be variables involved to make our code more organized and make the search easier. 

## Managing Complexity
 

## Procedural Abstraction
We will create a search engine where the user can search for their symptoms and identify what sickness they have. The search engine will be able to narrow down the results of the different illnesses the user may have. 

## Algorithm Implementation
We are going to create a function that takes user inputs and compares them to a list of data that we have from the API. We will code the function to respond accordingly based on the user input. How is still to be determined

## Testing
We will use the search function and search up common illnesses like stomachache, flu, cold, etc and see if the program gives us the right output for the illnesses.
