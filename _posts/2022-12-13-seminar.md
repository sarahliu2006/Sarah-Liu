# Kathyleen Beveridge

"My mission in life is not to survive, but to thrive and to do so with some passion, compassion and some humor and some style"

Finance Management

HP: Create technology that makes life better for everyone, everywhere
Qualcomm: Inventing the tech the world loves
Thermo Fisher Scientific: Enable our customers to make the world healthier cleaner and safer

All of these companies provide service and product for others, make a macro impact on people

Job is similar to a scrum master's, project management is just as important as creating and providing the product
