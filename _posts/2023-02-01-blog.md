# 5.3 Computing Bias
Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
Facebook: 25-34, TikTok: 10-19
I think that there is exclusion between the platforms but that is mostly due to a generation gap. I don’t think it’s very harmful at all because it’s a natural divide. It definitely is good business because each individual company caters to their target audience

Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
Virtual assistants have female voices because it’s more pleasing to hear and easier to understand. It may also be connected to the submissive nature of virtual assistants. I think it’s a little harmful because it promotes bias that women are viewed as assistants and can be corrected by assigning a gender neutral voice. It is good business though, because it caters to most humans’s preferences.

Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google)
One algorithm that influences a lot of people’s lives is the TikTok algorithm. There are many trends that spread because of it, which influences real world actions. This can be both harmful and beneficial. Companies like Instagram and Facebook will feed you content that will keep you on their site longer, which would make them more ad revenue.

# Pair work (Video on HP computers are racist)
Q1: Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? A1: It’s hard to tell, but he seems to be jokingly upset at the computer for not recognizing him for his skin color.

Q2: How do you think this happened? A2: I think it was because of the bad lighting in the video. Additionally, the face recognition program may have been trained on people with lighter skin.

Q3: Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? A3: Yes, it is harmful because it excludes a large group of people. I don’t think it was intended to be harmful because that would be bad business.

Q4: Should it be corrected? A4: Yes.

Q5: What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? A5: Train the facial recognition program with darker skin color.
