## Metadata Introduction

Meta data is not in the post, but something that surrounds the post, that people know about it but itsnt intrinsic to its being

Frontmatter is an example of metadata, like the top bar and saying the date when something was created, or saying is this or that


## Liquid

Liquid exists in the coding environment, and then once it reaces the browser it transforms into something else that is useful in browser. 

Liquid tells us the function, iteration to repeat itself and then disappears once it finishes its job.
