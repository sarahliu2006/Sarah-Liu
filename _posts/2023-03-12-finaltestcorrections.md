What I answered: A, Public key encryption is widely used because of the functionality it provides in addressing cybersecurity issues when sending information across the Internet.
The correct answer: C, As an email message passes through the Internet, it goes through intermediate computers and routers. These computers and routers could read the contents of the email. The credit card number could be read from the email.

What I answered: D, Statement III indicates that it would be better for the author to use a Creative Commons license because the author wants to allow permission to use and modify the e-book.
The correct answer: C, Statement I is correct because the Creative Commons license is designed to increase the amount of content available to the public for free. Statement III is correct because under Creative Commons the author can stipulate what kind of modification is allowed by users.

What I answered: C, Both online newspapers and social media sites make information widely accessible.
The correct answer: B, Online newspapers are usually run out in the open, in that the people who create the newspaper are clearly noted on the website. In addition, these online newspapers are often connected to physical newspapers, which are considered credible sources of information.

Question 19:

What I answered: A, The resultList contains only items from inputList1 that are also found in inputList2. 
The correct answer: B,  Each item in inputList1 is checked to see if it appears in inputList2. If the item appears in inputList2, the item is appended to resultList. Since resultList is initially empty, at the end of the FOR EACH loop resultList will contain precisely the elements that appear in both initial lists.

Question 26:

What I answered: B, With this algorithm, it is possible that the same student will be selected twice instead of 2 different students being selected.
The correct answer: D, This algorithm selects 1 student from the group of 30 students, then selects another student from the remaining 29 students. Any possible pair of students is equally likely to be selected.

What I answered: C, The fourth statement assigns the value false to a. The fifth statement assigns the value false to c.
The correct answer: B, The first three statements assign values to the variables. The fourth statement assigns the value of (NOT (a OR b)) AND c to a. Since a OR b is true, NOT (a OR b) is false, so (NOT (a OR b)) AND c is false. The fifth statement assigns the value of c AND a to c. Since a is now false, c AND a is false. The last three statements display the values of the variables.
