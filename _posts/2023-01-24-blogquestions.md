# Blog Post Reflection
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
| Pros | Cons |
| ---- | ---- |
| Computing helps us become more informed with news that we may not know from commmunicating with other people | Computers can cause people to spend too much time sitting down and looking at a screen. This can have bad long term affects on ones eyesight and physical health. It can also effect a person's social life because they can become addicted to a screen. |
| Computers have a very efficient way to organize and store data like photos, notes from class and important files so that it is still easy to access yet kept in a safe space | Not all computing technology is used to good intentions, like how the military may use their access to technology to hack into another country's server |
| Computing helps improve quality of life to help make our lives easier and more efficient like copy and paste, where rather than typing the same thing over and over again you can use ctrl-c and ctrl-v to do the same thing in a shorter amount of time | There is a digital divide, where people who may not be able to afford electronics may feel disconnected and left out from opportunities from people who have access to technology |

2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
I use my computer for many reasons: school, homework, extracurriculars, communicating with peers, etc. Sometimes when I lose track of time, I spend the whole day in front of a computer screen, either being productive or wasting time. I could either have a lot of homework that needs to be done or I could be bingewatching my favorite show. Because the computer gives me access to almost let me do anything I want, I can easily get distracted from a Youtube video or online shopping, which can cause me to procrasinate. Yet again, my computer is also used for productivity, where I can do my research for my English paper or go on Khan Academy to learn a new skill to further develop my knowledge on my academics.

How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
