# Overall Score: 24/25

# What I got Wrong: Question 21

What I answered:
A. Filter by photographer, then filter by year, then sort by subject
C. Sort by subject, then sort by year, then filter by photographer

The actual answer:
B. Filter by photographer, then filter by year, then sort by year

Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Sorting by year will sort the remaining entries in column C from least to greatest, putting the photograph with the lowest year value in the first row of the spreadsheet.
 
D. Sort by year, then filter by year, then filter by photographer

Sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet.
