# What I got Wrong: Question 21

<img src= "https://github.com/sarahliu2006/Sarah-Liu/blob/802f5ffc6045e454c2bdc62684c635098a08f21f/_notebooks/images/bigidea21.PNG?raw=true">

What I answered:
A. Filter by photographer, then filter by year, then sort by subject
C. Sort by subject, then sort by year, then filter by photographer

The actual answer:
B. Filter by photographer, then filter by year, then sort by year

Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Sorting by year will sort the remaining entries in column C from least to greatest, putting the photograph with the lowest year value in the first row of the spreadsheet.
 
D. Sort by year, then filter by year, then filter by photographer

Sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet.


# Questions I struggled with 

When I was taking the test, I noticed that I've always struggled with questions similar to 21 like question 16, 19, 20, 23. I think this is because these questions had more content compared to the other questions. To add on, the questions asked for certain parameters that had to be written in a code format, which took a long time because they gave a lot of parameters and you needed to know which parameter is written where and how.

# Commits

I feel like though I have been doing work each week, I realize that I don't commit my changes and contributions as much as I should- which is something I will work on. 

# Individual CPT Plans 

For the CPT, my role is the Backend. I plan to make sure my group's backend is working and fully functioning.
After speaking with Mort, we plan to have separate simulations for each member.
My part of the project is going to be the a card game, and I will most likely try to incorporate binary through the use of images.

import random

cards = ["Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"] 
suits = ["Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades", "Clubs"]

print(random.choice(cards) + " of " + random.choice(suits))

# Summary

Overall, I'm very satisfied with my score and I hope I can continue to score as high as this quiz. Even though the score for this quiz is higher than my average test scores,there are still some things I can definetely work on to improve my score.
