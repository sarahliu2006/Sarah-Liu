            "content": "Sarah Liu . Ms. Darcey-Hall . Period 4 . 21 August 2022 . Rhetorical Precis . In the article “Op-Ed: We’re teaching kids to follow their dreams. Maybe teach them to be helpful instead”, Joel Stein stresses the difference between a figure who leads change rather than a figure who helps create change, that being someone who advocates and takes action is someone more helpful than one who is a leader of change. Stein develops his viewpoint using his son’s 4th grade class, where all the students had to choose a famous person to become in a “Living Wax Museum”. Through Stein’s observations, most of the students choose people that weren’t labeled as “problematic” or “evil”, but rather more “heroic”, even “virtuous”. He found this very infuriating because he found out that his son wanted to go as Nixon or Trump, “but was told that he had to pick a person who was admirable.” (Stein 4). This was even more angered when he saw a student dress up as Ghandi while also spreading false information about a man who wasn’t as heroic as textbooks say he was. Stein’s opinionful article reveals that exposing children to certain things will only prevent them to do greater things. His frustrated tone appeals to readers with interest in doing rather than leading. .",

JavaScript developer leaves Console open all the time!!! | The function console.log() outputs to Console, this is often used for inspection or debugging. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. Developer call this a hard coded string. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; literal is a parameter to console.log(), element.txt() and alert(). | The element.txt function is part of Jupyter Notebook %%js magic. This is convenient for Notebook and testing. | The alert command outputs the parameter to a dialog box, so you can see it in this Jupyter notebook. The alert commands are shown, but are commented out as the stop run all execution of the notebook. | Note, in a Web Application Debugging: An alert is often used for less savy Developers. Console is used by more savy developers; console often requires setting up a lot of outputs. Source level debugging is the most powerful solution for debugging and does not require alert or console commands. | . %%js // required to allow cell to be JavaScript enabled console.log(&quot;JavaScript/Jupyter Output Intro&quot;); // Browser Console output; debugging or tracing console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); console.log(&quot;Hello, World Again!&quot;); // Document Object Model (DOM) output; output to HTML, CSS which is standard for a Web Page // &lt;mark&gt;select element method&lt;/mark&gt;: DOM native JavaScript get, document.getElementByID document.getElementById(&quot;output&quot;).textContent = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // &lt;mark&gt;jQuery CSS-style method&lt;/mark&gt;: Tag for DOM selector, $(&#39;#output&#39;) $(&#39;#output&#39;).append(&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello World Again!&#39;); // br is break or new line, b is bold // Jupyter built in magic element for testing and convenience of development element.text(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); // element is output option as part of %%js magic element.append(&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello World Again!&#39;); //alert(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . multiple outputs using one variable . This second example is a new sequence of code, two or more lines of code forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, thank goodness!!! In the previous example we were typing the string &quot;Hello, World&quot; over and over. Observe with the variable msg=&quot;Hello, World!&quot;; we type the string once and now use msg over and over. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console, be sure to Inspect it! | The element.text() is part of Jupyter Notebooks and displays as output blow the code on this page. Until we build up some more interesting data for Web Site, we will not use be using the Python HTML, CSS technique. | The alert(msg) works the same as previous, but as the other commands uses msg as parameter. | . %%js console.log(&quot;Variable Definition&quot;); var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // Use msg to output code to Console and Jupyter Notebook console.log(msg); //right click browser select Inspect, then select Console to view element.text(msg); //alert(msg); . output showing use of a function . This example passes the defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are multiple steps in this code.. The &quot;definition of the function&quot;: &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. Passing a parameter is required when you call this function. | The &quot;call to the function:&quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually runs the function. The variable &quot;msg&quot; is used a parameter when calling the logIt function. | . | Showing reuse of function... There are two calls to the logIt function | This is called Prodedural Abstraction, a term that means reusing the same code | . | . %%js console.log(&quot;Function Definition&quot;); /* Function: logIt * Parameter: output * Description: The parameter is &quot;output&quot; to console and jupyter page */ function logIt(output) { console.log(output); element.append(output + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); //alert(output); } // First sequence calling logIt function var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; logIt(msg); // Second sequence calling logIt function var msg = &quot;Hello, &lt;b&gt;Students&lt;/b&gt;!&quot; // replaces content of variable var classOf = &quot;Welcome CS class of 2023-2024.&quot; logIt(msg + &quot; &quot; + classOf); // concatenation of strings . output showing Loosely typed data . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. . To define a variable you prefix the name with var or const. The variable type is determined by JavaScript at runtime. | Python and many interpretive languages are loosely typed like JavaScript. This is considered programmer friendly. | Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see terms like String, Integer, Double, and Object in the source code. | In JavaScript, the typeof keyword returns the type of the variable. Become familiar with type as it is valuable in conversation and knowing type help you understand how to modify data. Each variable type will have built in methods to manage content within the data type. | . %%js console.log(&quot;Examine Data Types&quot;); // Function to add typeof to output function getType(output) { return typeof output + &quot;: &quot; + output; } // Function defintion function logIt(output) { console.log(getType(output)); // logs string console.info(output); // logs object element.append(getType(output) + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // adds to Jupyter output //alert(getType(output)); } // Common Types element.append(&quot;Common Types &lt;br&gt;&quot;); logIt(&quot;Mr M&quot;); // String logIt(1997); // Number logIt(true); // Boolean element.append(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // Object Type, this definition is often called a array or list element.append(&quot;Object Type, array &lt;br&gt;&quot;); var scores = [ 90, 80, 100 ]; logIt(scores); element.append(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // Complex Object, this definition is often called hash, map, hashmap, or dictionary element.append(&quot;Object Type, hash or dictionary &lt;br&gt;&quot;); var person = { // key:value pairs seperated by comma &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;role&quot;: &quot;Teacher&quot; }; logIt(person); logIt(JSON.stringify(person)); //method used to convert this object into readable format . Build a Person object and JSON . JavaScript and other languages have special properties and syntax to store and represent data. In fact, a class in JavaScript is a special function. . Definition of class allows for a collection of data, the &quot;class Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of a Person. | Instance of a class, the &quot;const teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; makes an object &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;class Person&quot;. | Setting and Getting properties After creating teacher and student objects, observe that properties can be changed/muted or extracted/accessed. | . %%html &lt;!-- load jQuery and tablesorter scripts --&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;!-- load jQuery and tablesorter scripts --&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.tablesorter/2.31.3/js/jquery.tablesorter.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;style&gt; /* CSS-style selector maps to table id or other id&#39;s in HTML */ #jsonTable, #flaskTable { background-color: #353b45; padding: 10px; border: 3px solid #ccc; box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- Table for writing and extracting jsonText --&gt; &lt;table id=&quot;jsonTable&quot;&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Classroom JSON Data&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;jsonText&quot;&gt;{&quot;classroom&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;object&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;sample&quot;,&quot;ghID&quot;:&quot;sample&quot;,&quot;classOf&quot;:2000,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;sample&quot;}]}&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . .

            "title": "P3-M 4/28 Introduction to SASS",
            "content": "What is SASS? . Sass is a preprocessor language that&#39;s interpreted into CSS. A preprocessor language takes input data and converts it to an output that&#39;s used as input by another program. This means when you run Sass code, you&#39;re actually converting your code to CSS. That CSS code output is then used directly by a browser. Fun fact CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. . SCSS vs. CSS . Understanding the differences between SCSS and CSS . What is CSS . CSS is the default technology that most programmers use when styling webpage. It is one of the 3 fundamental web technologies along with HTML and JavaScript. HTML manages the structure, JavaScript makes pages interactive, and CSS changes the style by taking a markup language like HTML and describes how it should be presented to the user. . | However, CSS is not very easy to work with lacking a lot features often making using CSS very confusing and difficult or hard to work with on lengthy projects. This is why there are tools like Bootstrap, Sass, and Tailwind that make styling a lot easier and more efficient. We will be using Sass in this course. . | . CSS Example . This is an example of CSS that can be used to change body text of an HTML document | Hack Question:Can you guess what its changing style of the text to? - Changes to font of the text to blue sans-serif size 16 pixels | . body{ color: #0000FF; font-family: Ariel, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; } . What is SCSS . SCSS is short for Sassy Cascading Style Sheets. | SCSS very similar to CSS but the difference comes with the fact that SCSS extends the functionality of CSS while also making it simpler. What this allows us to do is it enables us to things like nested styling, functions, mixins, variables, inheritance (more on these later) and so on. | . Sass Code Example . $blue: #0000FF; body{ color: $blue; font-family: Ariel, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; } . This example is doing the same thing as the other code segment above but the difference being that here we defined the color as $blue which makes it much easier for us to recall later on. In fact, we have done this before, if you have been using the dark mode/midnight theme then go ahead and navigate your your _sass folder and check out the dark-mode.scss and you&#39;ll see something similar to the example above | . So which one is better to use? . CSS tends to be better for really simple styling where not many complex or nested styles are required and small projects that doesn&#39;t require a lot of customization. | SCSS on the other hand is very good for more complex styling and working with a project with more than one page where maybe lots of customization is needed. Such as the projects we made last and first trimester. | . Modular SCSS . Understanding how to use modular SCSS . Modular SCSS allows you to break multiple different files and then be able to compile them into a single CSS file | How do you do this? Well all you need to do is have _filenames.scss so that is compiled into its own file | Now after adding the to the file name you can import it into you file without the and all the styles will be carried over. | The benefits of a partial is that it allows you to big websites and allows you to break up the code in multiple components and easily make changes instead of having to go through a huge file. | All styles in the partial will be added and can be used into the main file as if they were defined in the main file. | . File 1 _variable.scss . $primary-button-color: #009494; $hover-color: black; $menu-color: #f2f2f2; . File 2 style.scss . We can see the importing of the .scss file&#39;s content into the other main .scss file style.scss | . {@import &#39;variables&#39;; @import &quot;{{ site.theme }}&quot;;} /* &quot;row style&quot; is flexible size and aligns pictures in center */ .row { align-items: center; display: flex; } /* &quot;column style&quot; is one-third of the width with padding */ .column { flex: 33.33%; padding: 5px; } .menu a { // float: left; display: block; color: $menu-color; text-align: center; // padding: 14px 16px; text-decoration: none; } .menu a:hover { background: $primary-button-color; color: $hover-color; } . Nesting . What is nesting? Where did the birds come from? . Nesting is a way to organize your code and make it easier to read. It also helps keep your code DRY (Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself). | Nesting is when you put one selector inside another selector. This is a great way to keep your code organized and make it easier to read. | When we make HTML we often nest different elements within each other and have a clear structure when we look at it. | The problem is that in regular CSS we don&#39;t have that so we need to use SASS to help us organize our code. | . Warning:Don&#39;t nest too much as when the CSS is processed it can make overqualified selectors which can be hard to read and maintain. Which means that it would only target that specific element type and not any other elements that have the same class name. ## Sass Nesting | Through nesting the ul, li, and a selectors within the nav selector makes your CSS better and increases its readability overall. | . nav { ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style: none; } li { display: inline-block; } a { display: block; padding: 6px 12px; text-decoration: none; } } . CSS - Lack of Nesting . We can see that through the lack of nesting the CSS is not as organized and needs extra information to be able to make it more clear exactly what is being targeted. | . nav ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style: none; } nav li { display: inline-block; } nav a { display: block; padding: 6px 12px; text-decoration: none; } . Variables . What is a variable? . A variable is a container that stores information so for instance when you multiple places that refer to one value you can just use the variable name instead of the value. | This is valuable in SASS because it allows you to reuse that value in multiple places throughout you stylesheet. | Variables in CSS preprocessors such as Sass allow you to store information that you can reuse in your stylesheet, such as font stacks, colors, or any other CSS value you anticipate needing. The $ symbol is used in Sass to designate a variable. | . Pro Tip:The reason SASS variables are better than variables in regular CSS is that they are more consider and easier to read with a much simpler syntax. Fun Fact: Variables in SASS came before CSS and often SASS has features long before they are actually added to CSS as a whole. . Variable Example Syntax . $variable-name: value; | Once the sass is processed the variable name is replaced with the value throughout the program. | . $main-font: Calibri, sans-serif; $main-color: #000; $main-color-hover: #000; . Operators . Operators are used to perform operations on variables and other aspects of the language like in python we can use operators to see if values are equal, add, divide, subtract, multiply, etc. | SASS has a lot of operators that can be used to perform operations on variables and other aspects of the language as well. They can include == to check if two values are equal and != to check if two values are not equal | + to add two values together | - to subtract two values | * to multiply two values | / to divide two values | % to find the remainder of two values | &lt; to check if one value is less than another | &gt; to check if one value is greater than another | &lt;= to check if one value is less than or equal to another | &gt;= to check if one value is greater than or equal to another | Also there is and, or, &amp; not to be able to use boolean operations | . | . Operator Example Syntax . Operators are used in this example to perform string concatenation | . // Html &lt;p id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;original text and&lt;/p&gt; // SASS #testing:after{ content: &quot; some&quot; + &quot; more&quot; + &quot; text&quot;; } // Output original text and some more text . Conditional Statements . There are conditional statements in SASS just like in Python and JavaScript they work the same way as well. | Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Such as if a certain condition is true then do this, if it is false then do that and so on. | SASS has @if which allows for different styles based on if a boolean expression was true or false. | SASS has @else which allows for different set of styles if the if condition was not met or false. | SASS has @else if which allows for an alternative conditions to be run if the first is not met. | . $color: red; button { @if $color == red { background-color: $color; } } // @else: allows you to provide an alternative set of styles to apply if the condition in the @if statement isn&#39;t met $color: blue; button { @if $color == red { background-color: red; } @else { background-color: $color; } } // @else if: allows you to provide multiple alternative conditions to test $color: green; button { @if $color == red { background-color: red; } @else if $color == blue { background-color: blue; } @else { background-color: $color; } } . Loops In Sass . Loops are present in SASS through the @for and @while decorators, along with @each. | Loops are used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times or until a certain condition is met just like in any other programming language. . For Loops: Are used to iterate through a value like a list or a range of numbers | While Loops: Are used to iterate through a block of code until a certain condition is met such as a value is being equal to a certain value through an incrementing or decrementing a variable or any other condition that is met. | . | When using while loops they can be necessary but it is better to use @each and @for as it will make it clear and be able to compile faster. . | Side Note: In SASS lists care a any group of values that are separated by a comma or a space there is no special brackets used like in python or javascript. Lists can be searched for values however they are immutable meaning that they cannot be changed once they are created. . | . Some Code Examples of Loops and Lists . // A for each loop is used to interact with a group of sizes changing // the size of the element for each item in the list $sizes: 40px, 50px, 80px; @each $size in $sizes { .icon-#{$size} { font-size: $size; height: $size; width: $size; } } // @each: allows you to loop over a list of values and generate styles $colors: red, green, blue; @each $color in $colors { .color-#{$color} { background-color: $color; } } . @debug list.index(1px solid red, 1px); // 1 @debug list.index(1px solid red, solid); // 2 @debug list.index(1px solid red, dashed); // null . @use &quot;sass:math&quot;; /// Divides `$value` by `$ratio` until it&#39;s below `$base`. @function scale-below($value, $base, $ratio: 1.618) { @while $value &gt; $base { $value: math.div($value, $ratio); } @return $value; } $normal-font-size: 16px; sup { font-size: scale-below(20px, 16px); } . $base-color: #036; @for $i from 1 through 3 { ul:nth-child(3n + #{$i}) { background-color: lighten($base-color, $i * 5%); } } // @for: allows you to loop over a range of values and generate styles @for $i from 1 through 3 { .item-#{$i} { width: 100px * $i; } } . Functions in SASS . What is a function? . A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. This is a great method to be able to reuse code and processes in a manner that is more efficient and allows for the reuse of code. We do this all the time in programming languages such as JavaScript and Python. | . SASS functions . Sass Functions allow you to define complex calculations and transformations that can be used throughout your stylesheet and allow you to perform complex operations on values, manipulate data, plus you can generate content dynamically. . | There a are built in functions and ones you can make on your own like languages such as JavaScript and Python. . | SASS functions can be used to perform arithmetic operations, manipulate colors, work with strings, and more. . | Functions in SASS are similar to functions in programming languages, but they can be used within SASS stylesheets to generate CSS code dynamically. . | . Using Built-in Functions . Like Python and Javascript SASS provides a variety of built-in functions for math, color manipulation, string manipulation, and more. | . Math Functions . SASS has many functions that allow you to be able to perform wide range of math operations similar to the ones present in python including more complex operations. | . .round(1.2); // returns 1 .ceil(1.2); // returns 2 .floor(1.2); // returns 1 .abs(-1.2); // returns 1.2 .min(1, 2, 3); // returns 1 .max(1, 2, 3); // returns 3 .random(1, 100); // returns a random number between 1 and 100 . Color Functions . Color is an important component of any website and SASS provides a wide range of functions that allow you to manipulate colors in a variety of ways. | . .lighten(#007fff, 20%); // returns a lighter shade of blue .darken(#007fff, 20%); // returns a darker shade of blue .opacify(#007fff, 0.2); // makes the color more opaque .transparentize(#007fff, 0.2); // makes the color more transparent .mix(#007fff, #ff0000, 50%); // returns a mix of two colors . String Functions . SASS provides a variety of string functions that allow you to manipulate strings. Here are some examples: | . .to-upper-case(&quot;hello world&quot;); // returns &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot; .to-lower-case(&quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;); // returns &quot;hello world&quot; .str-index(&quot;hello world&quot;, &quot;world&quot;); // returns the index of the first occurrence of &quot;world&quot; .str-insert(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot; world&quot;, 5); // inserts &quot; world&quot; into &quot;hello&quot; at position 5 . Creating Custom Functions . In addition to using built-in functions, you can also create your own functions in SASS using the @function name(arguments){} | @return is similar to the return statement in JavaScript and Python. It returns a value from a function. | Functions take input values, perform calculations, and return a result. Here&#39;s an example of a simple function that calculates the area of a rectangle: | . @function rectangle-area($width, $height) { @return $width * $height; } // Usage: $area: rectangle-area(10px, 20px); // Returns 200px . Or you can also make a different kind of function that increases the font size to the factorial of a inputted number. | . @function factorial($number){ $calculated: 1; @for $_ from 1 through $number { $calculated: $calculated*$number; } @return $calculated; } #testing { font-size: factorial(3); } . //Combining functions and loops to achieve different sass effects @function sum($numList){ $sum: 0; @each $num in $numList { $sum: $sum+$num; } @return $num; } @function tri($num){ $sum: 0; @for $i from 1 through $num { $sum: $sum+$num; } @return $sum; } @function max($nums){ $i:0; $value:0px; @while $i&lt;length($nums){ @if $value&lt;list.nth($nums,$i){ $value:list.nth($nums,$i); } } } . Custom functions are very powerful, and can be used to create reusable pieces of code that can be used throughout your stylesheets. . | SASS functions are a powerful feature that allow you to perform complex operations on values, manipulate data, and generate content dynamically. By using built-in functions and creating your own custom functions, you can greatly extend the capabilities of your SASS stylesheets. . | . Mixins . Mixin what is a mix in what are we mixing in? . Mixins are a way to make groups of CSS that you want to reuse throughout your site anywhere you please. | Mixins are a form of template and that you can use to build on top of to make different features later on this prevents you from having to write the same code over and over again. | This is a form of encapsulation in your CSS and is a great way to make your code more organized and easier to read. | Mixins can also take in arguments and be able to be used to apply effects on certain elements if that is a feature you want to add to your site. However unlike functions which also take arguments mixins cannot return values. | To use a mixin declare it with @mixin and then incorporate with @include. | . Inheritance . What is inheritance? . In general programming concept where the child class can inherit properties from the parent class. These properties can be changed and modified in the child class. This prevents code from being repeated and makes the code more usable and flexible. | In SASS we have a similar concept that can be used as well we can create base styles and then have other styles inherit from them and then we can change them as we please. | We can do that by through using @extend .name-of-class and then we can add more styles to it as we please. Simple as that | . Mixin &amp; Inheritance Code Example . // example of @mixin @mixin button { width: auto; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; background-color: #21807c; border: 3px solid black; font-size: 1.5em; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; grid-column: span 1; grid-row: span 1; // creates smooth animation effect transition: all 0.5s; } // default button theme for calculator and stopwatch buttons. Both will follow the same button format .button { // uses the scss from the @mixin @include button; } /* styling for the calculator clear button */ .calculator-button-clear { // @extend inherits .button and then changes the background color from .button @extend .button; background-color: #e68b1c; } /* styling for the calculator equals button */ .calculator-button-equals { // another @extend inherits .button and then changes the background color from .button @extend .button; background-color: #e70f0f; } . Hacks &amp; Hack Helper - Calculator &amp; Hack Helper - Stopwatch . All hacks are pair/trio hacks, individual hacks are not recommended and will not be accepted unless a valid reason is given.

            "title": "Big Idea 2 - Data Related to User Guide",
            "content": "Introduction . When building an application that requires users to create accounts or sign in, handling data related to users is crucial. This data can include things like user profiles, preferences, and activity logs, which can be used to personalize the user experience and improve the application&#39;s performance. . By learning how to handle data related to users effectively and efficiently, you&#39;ll be equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to build helpful applications that meet the needs of your users. . PLEASE DON&#39;T OPEN THE POPCORN HACKS, WE WILL OPEN THEM DURING THE PRESENTATION . Basics of Class and User Data . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . Because Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, everything in it represents an object. Lists, dictionaries, functions, etc. are all examples of Python objects. Generally speaking, a Python object is an entity of data items and methods describing the behavior of those items. . A Python class is a template used to create Python objects. We can think of it as a cooking recipe, where all the ingredients and their quantities are listed, and the whole process of cooking is described step-by-step. . In this case, we can compare a cake recipe to a class, and a cake cooked following that recipe to an object (i.e., an instance of that class). Using the same recipe (class), we can create many cakes (objects). This is the essence of creating a class in Python: to define data elements and the rules establishing how these elements can interact and change their state — and then use this framework to build various objects in a set way, instead of creating them from scratch every time. . Let&#39;s look at a few examples: . class Bikes: name = &quot;&quot; gear = 0 # create objects of class bike1 = Bikes() # objectName = ClassName() bike2 = Bikes() . Now that we have our class and object defined, we can now run code to modify certain attributes of our objects. . bike1.gear = 11 bike1.name = &quot;Mountain Bike&quot; bike2.gear = 13 bike2.name = &quot;Road Bike&quot; print(f&quot;Name: {bike1.name}, Gears: {bike1.gear} &quot;) . Name: Mountain Bike, Gears: 11 . Popcorn Hacks #1: Add another print command to display the attributes of Bike #2. What output will this code segment produce? print(f&quot;Name: {bike2.name}, Gears: {bike2.gear} &quot;) . Name: Road Bike, Gears: 13 . Example: Defining a User Class . Now we will look into Classes for users of a program or website. . class User: def __init__(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . For this cell, we define a User class with a constructor method &quot;init&quot; that takes username and email as arguments. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . For backend functionality, this class can be used to create, manipulate, and manage user data. For example, when a new user signs up for an account, you could create a new User object with their username and email. This object can then be used to perform various operations, such as validating the user&#39;s input, storing the user&#39;s data in a database, or processing user-related requests. . Now let&#39;s make a new User: . new_user = User(&quot;jeffrey&quot;, &quot;leejeffreysc@gmail.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Username: jeffrey, Email: leejeffreysc@gmail.com . Here&#39;s a step-by-step breakdown of how the code relates to backend functionality: . new_user = User(&quot;jeffrey&quot;, &quot;leejeffreysc@gmail.com&quot;): This line creates a new User object, initializing it with the username &quot;jeffrey&quot; and the email &quot;leejeffreysc@gmail.com&quot;. This could represent a user who has just signed up for an account, and the input values would typically come from user input, such as a frontend signup form. . new_user.display_info(): This line calls the display_info method on the new_user object, which prints the user&#39;s information (username and email) to the console. In a real-world backend application, you might use this method or a similar one to display user information in logs, send a welcome email, or create an API response with the user&#39;s data. . User/Class @ Decorators: . A Python Class allows for the use of @ decorators, these allow access to attribute data without the use of functions. . @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to &quot;GET&quot; attribute data in a clean method (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to &quot;UPDATE&quot;/set attribute data in a clean method (object.name = &quot;Jeffrey&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;Jeffrey&quot;)) | . The getter and setter methods provide a clean and controlled way to set and get the attributes of an object. This can be particularly useful when interacting with databases, APIs, or other parts of a web application that require the management and manipulation of object attributes. . class Student: def __init__(self, student, name): self._student = student self._name = name @property def name(self): return self._name @name.setter def name(self, new_name): self._name = new_name . In this example, the Student class has a name attribute, which is accessed and modified through the name property getter and setter methods. The _name attribute uses an underscore prefix, which is a convention to indicate it should not be accessed directly. . Usage of the getter and setter methods are below: . student = Student(1001, &quot;Derek Sol&quot;) print(student.name) # Get the name using the getter method student.name = &quot;Jagger Klein&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(student.name) . Derek Sol Jagger Klein . Popcorn Hacks #2: The following code segment for computers does not have getter and setter methods called. Using the missing attributes &quot;model&quot; and &quot;year&quot;, add example getter and setters methods for this class. Show us an example output that this code segment might produce. class Computer: def __init__(self, model, year): self._model = model self._year = year @property def model(self): return self._model @model.setter def model(self, new_model): self._model = new_model @property def year(self): return self._year @year.setter def year(self, new_year): self._year = new_year . comp = Computer(&quot;Dell&quot;, 2015) print(comp.model) print(comp.year) . Dell 2015 . Databases and SQLite . A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and management of that data. In other words, a database is a software application that allows you to store and manage large amounts of data in an organized manner. . Some Examples of Databases: . Storing and managing customer data, such as contact information, order history, and customer preferences. | Keeping track of inventory levels and stock movements in a warehouse or retail store. | Managing financial transactions, such as payments, invoices, and receipts. | . SQLite is a software library that provides a user-friendly database management system. Unlike other databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite is programmed within an application, which means it does not require a separate server process to operate. This makes SQLite great for web applications or for use in situations where you don&#39;t need a full database server. . In this lesson, we will be demonstrating how to set up a SQLite database in Flask, a Python web framework. Flask allows programmers to easily interact with SQLite databases, and we&#39;ll walk through the process of setting up a new database, creating tables, and adding data. We&#39;ll also cover some basic SQL commands that you can use to interact with your database, including CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. . Setting up a SQLite database in Flask . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE students (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, grade INTEGER)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . Note: This will create a new file &#39;database.db&#39; in the _notebooks folder if one doesn&#39;t exist. . Breaking down this code segment: . We imported the necessary libraries and tools | We created a Flask application | We connected to the SQLite database using SQLite3 | We created a cursor object to execute SQL commands | We created tables in the database using SQL commands | . Flask provides several extensions and tools for working with SQLite databases, including Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-SQLite3, and Flask-Admin. These tools provide a high-level interface for interacting with the database, making it easy to perform common operations such as adding, updating, and deleting records. . CRUD Commands with SQLite . CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the basic operations you can perform on data. SQL is useful library because it allows programmers to create new tables to organize data, add new data to a table, update data that&#39;s already there, or delete data that&#39;s no longer needed. . C: To create a new record in a database, you must first define the table structure that will store the data. This can be accomplished using SQL commands such as CREATE. Once the table is created, data can be added to it using the INSERT INTO command. . | R: To retrieve data from the database, you can use the READ command. You can specify which fields you want to retrieve and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. There are also several functions available to aggregate and manipulate data. . | U: To modify existing data in the database, you can use the UPDATE command. You will need to specify which table and fields you want to update, and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. . | D: To remove data from the database, you can use the DELETE command. . | . Example of CRUD within an SQLite Database . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE basketball (_player TEXT PRIMARY KEY, _team TEXT, _position TEXT, _opinion TEXT)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . Hypothetically, our programmer wanted to create an application about basketball players, and created a new table in SQL to store and interact with user-submitted data. Using the same method as the previous table, a new table &#39;basketball&#39; is created by the cursor and added to the &#39;database.db&#39; file. . Create Function: . def create(): database = &#39;database.db&#39; player = input(&quot;Enter the player name&quot;) team = input(&quot;Enter team name&quot;) position = input(&quot;Enter player position&quot;) opinion = input(&quot;Enter your opinion &quot;) # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record in to db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO basketball (_player, _team, _position, _opinion) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (player, team, position, opinion)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;New basketball with {player} is added.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record&quot;, error) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() . The create() feature allows users to input information about a basketball player and store it in a SQLite table &#39;basketball&#39; inside the database file we already created &#39;database.db&#39;. The code prompts the user for the player&#39;s name, team name, position, and their opinion about the player, then establishes a connection to the SQLite database and creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands. . The cursor.execute() method is called with an SQL INSERT command to insert a new entry into the &#39;basketball&#39; table. The connection.commit() method saves the changes to the database, and if the record is inserted successfully, a confirmation message is printed. In case of errors, the except block catches the sqlite3.Error exception and prints an error message. Finally, the cursor and the connection to the database are closed, and the create() function is called to execute the code. . Read Function: . def read(): database = &#39;basketball.db&#39; # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() # Fetch all the records from basketball table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM basketball&#39;).fetchall() if len(results) != 0: for row in results: print(row) else: print(&quot;No player found.&quot;) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() read() . The read() feature retrieves and prints all entries from the &#39;basketball&#39; table in the specified SQLite database. The script establishes a connection to the SQLite database, creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands, and calls the cursor.execute() method with an SQL SELECT command to fetch all the entires from the &#39;basketball&#39; table. The fetchall() method retrieves all the rows returned by the SELECT command and stores them in the results variable. . The code then checks if there are any records in the table and, if so, iterates through each row in the results using a &#39;for loop&#39; and prints the row. If there are no records, the program prints &quot;No player found&quot;. Finally, the cursor and the connection to the database are closed, and the read() function is called to execute the code. . Update Function: . import sqlite3 def update(): database = &#39;database.db&#39; player = input(&quot;Enter a basketball player to update the opinion for:&quot;) opinion = input(&quot;Enter new opinion:&quot;) # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Updating review for the basketball cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE basketball SET _opinion = ? WHERE _player = ?&quot;, (opinion, player)) if cursor.rowcount != 0: print(f&quot;Review for the basketball is updated to {opinion}&quot;) connection.commit() else: print(f&quot;Player not found.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error occurred&quot;, error) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() update() . This update feature updates the opinion for a specific basketball player in an SQLite database. The code defines an update() function, which prompts the user to input the basketball player they want to update and the new opinion for that player. The script connects to the SQLite database, creates a cursor object, and handles any potential errors while executing the SQL command. The cursor.execute() method updates the review in the database for the specified basketball item. . If at least one value is changed, a success message is printed and the changes are committed to the database. Otherwise, a &quot;Player not found.&quot; message is displayed. In the except block, if an error occurs, an error message along with specific error details is printed. Finally, the cursor and connection to the database are closed, and the update() function is called to execute the review update process. . Delete Function . import sqlite3 def delete(): database = &#39;basketball.db&#39; player = input(&quot;Enter basketball player to delete&quot;) # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM basketball WHERE _player = ?&quot;, (player,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: print(f&quot;{player} does not exist&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Successfully deleted basketball player {player}&quot;) connection.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error occurred: &quot;, error) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() delete() . The delete feature deletes a specific basketball player from the specified SQLite database. The code defines a delete() function that prompts the user to input the basketball player they want to delete. After connecting to the SQLite database and creating a cursor object, the code handles potential errors while executing the SQL command. The cursor.execute() method is used to delete the basketball item with the specified ID. . If no rows are affected, a message is printed indicating that the basketball player does not exist. Otherwise, a success message is displayed, confirming the basketball player&#39;s deletion. The changes are then committed to the database. In the except block, any error that occurs triggers an error message along with specific error details. Finally, the cursor and connection to the database are closed, and the delete() function is called to execute the basketball item deletion process. This code showcases a practical way to remove information from an SQLite database based on user input. . Menu Functions: . Alongside the four CRUD functions, a menu function is designed to manage Create, Read, Update, Delete operations and display the schema. The menu function is responsible for taking in user inputs and making the program call various functions. When running a menu function, users enter their desired operation, whether it be Create, Read, Update, or Delete, and the input is checked by various conditions to determine which function should be called. Many menu functions are called recursively, so the cell will repeat the menu process until the user decides to exit. . Popcorn Hacks #3: The menu function below is missing some of the CRUD functions for the specified basketball players table. Fix the following code by adding the intended CRUD functions, then perform a READ function on the database. def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . Image Uploading with SQLite . Using various Python Libraries, we are able to upload and customize images using python code, as well as using images to interact with databases. . One way to store images in a database is to INSERT the image data as a binary blob. . To store an image as a blob in SQLite, you can first read the image file and convert it to a binary format using a programming language like Python. Here&#39;s an example of how to do this: . Making the Table to store our Image Data: . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE images (name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, data BLOB)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . We use a new data type &quot;BLOB&quot; to store specific data from our .jpg image. . Adding Image Data to our Table: . You can use this example sunset jpg for our code. Download and place it in the same repository as this notebook.

Question 1 What I answered: A, The code segment assigns the initial value of first to temp, then assigns the initial value of second to first. The initial value of second, which has been stored in first, is then assigned to second. Therefore, the value of second has not changed from its initial value. Actual Answer: B, The code segment assigns the initial value of first to temp, then assigns the initial value of second to first. The initial value of first, which has been stored in temp, is then assigned to second. Therefore, the initial values of first and second have been interchanged. . Question 4 What I answered: C, There are many possible temperature values, which would require each temperature to be stored as a numerical value instead of a Boolean value. Actual Answer: A, There are only two possible results of a coin flip, which can be stored in a Boolean variable as true or false. . Question 8 What I answered: C, The number of photos taken at a particular geographic location can be determined, but the name of the person who took the most recent photo cannot be determined. Actual Answer: B, The number of photos taken at a particular geographic location can be determined from the geographic data stored with each photo. The number of photos taken in the last year can be determined from the data and time data stored with each photo. The name of the person who took a photo is not captured in the photo data. . Question 9 What I answered: A, Unsolvable problems cannot be solved with an algorithm. Actual Answer: D, Incrementally adding code segments to correct, working programs can help programmers identify new errors that are introduced. . Question 11 What I answered: B, The code segment simulates a spinner in which selecting each of three sections is equally likely. Actual Answer: D, The code segment selects “Yellow” one-sixth of the time, “Blue” one-sixth of the time, and “Red” the remaining two-thirds of the time. . Question 21 What I answered: C, This code segment moves the robot forward three squares, rotates it right one time so that the robot faces the bottom of the grid, and then moves the robot forward three squares. Actual Answer: B, This code segment moves the robot forward two squares, rotates it right three times so that the robot faces the top of the grid, and then moves the robot forward three squares to the gray square. . Question 31 What I answered: A, Program II also correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the upper-left corner of the grid. Actual Answer: C, Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the upper-left corner of the grid. . Question 36 What I answered: C, If the operation was performed with the arguments in reverse order, the result would be 1.5. Actual Answer: B, The fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers (as floating-point numbers) limits the range of floating-point values. . Question 44 What I answered: A, The operation 4 plus 8 does not produce a result large enough to cause an overflow error. Actual Answer: B, With a 4-bit integer representation, 2 to the fourth power values can be represented, which allows for the values between 0 to 1 5, inclusive. If an operation results in a value greater than 1 5, an overflow error will occur. Of the operations given in the options, only 10 plus 7 gives a result larger than 1 5. . Questino 45 What I answered: A, The expression Open parenthesis, NOT P, close parenthesis, and, open parenthesis, NOT Q, close parenthesis evaluates to false when P and Q differ in value. A NANDgate should only evaluate to false when both inputs are true. Actual Answer: C, The expression P AND Q evaluates to true when both P and Q are true, and evaluates to false otherwise. Therefore, the expression NOT, open parenthesis, P AND Q, close parenthesis evaluates to false when both P and Q are true, and evaluates to true otherwise. . Question 55 What I answered: A, The procedure always returns false. Actual Answer: C, The expression open parenthesis, open parenthesis, response equals, open quotation, y, close quotation, close parenthesis, AND, open parenthesis, response equals, open quotation, yes, close quotation, close parenthesis, close parenthesisalways evaluates to false because it is not possible for the variable response to be equal to both Open quotation, y, close quotation and Open quotation, yes, close quotation. Therefore, the procedure will always return false. .",

Question 9: What I answered: B, A simulation that shows how packets move between clients and servers can demonstrate the impact of increased speeds for frequently-visited servers. Actual answer: A, Digital data on the Internet is sent by breaking data into blocks of bits called packets. The packets are reassembled by the user’s computer. . Question 10: What I answered: C, All data on a computer is stored in binary. Individual computers can interpret different file formats if each computer contains the appropriate software. The structure and functionality of the Internet does not affect the ability of two computers to share files. Actual answer: D, Devices on the Internet communicate using standard protocols, which do not depend on the manufacturer. . Question 19: What I answered: D, The database does not store information about the date of a particular sale. Actual answer: A, Because the database stores information on item identification numbers and quantities available, the retailer can search for all item identification numbers that have a quantity of 0. . Question 28: What I answered: A, too small, number should be bigger Actual answer: C, number is big enough to fill in all data . Question 30: What I answered: B Actual answer: A The binary notation is the one used by computers to perform all their calculations, it is based on two elements 0 and 1 The sum of the elements gives 0+ 0 = 0, 1+ 0 = 1, 0+ 1 = 1. In the case of the two elements being one, the result leads to an increase of the next element:1 +1 = 10, and the sum is repeated. In this case the number assigned to the student is: 10010011.When it increases by 1 the next student has the number 10010011 + 0000001 = 10010100 . Question 44: What I answered: B, Since the student cannot modify the search procedure’s code or internal abstractions, the argument passed to the search procedure must be a word, not a definition. Actual answer: C, The student knows that the procedure searches for a value without knowing how it does the searching. This is an example of the use of procedural abstraction. . Question 46: What I answered: C, The first call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (6, 5). The second call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (8, 7). The third call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (8, 3). Actual answer: B, This code segment draws the three line segments shown in the figure. The first call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (6, 5). The second call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (6, 7). The third call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (6, 3). . Question 49: What I answered: C, This code segment traverses the list beginning with the second element, so it is correctly comparing only the student scores to the maximum possible score. However, the code segment will fail to check the last element in the list. When index is equal to the length of the list, the loop will terminate without comparing the last student score in the list to the maximum possible score. Actual answer: A, This code segment traverses the list beginning with the second element, so it is correctly comparing only student scores to the maximum possible score, which is found by accessing scores[1]. The variable found will only be set to true when a student’s score equals the maximum possible score. The code also sets the number of iterations to LENGTH(scores) - 1 to reflect that the first list element (maximum score) is skipped. .",

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1) | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # That it only includes 3 numbers # It doesn&#39;t repeat any of the integers # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # Hashmaps and hastables can have duplicated values # . {1, 2, 3} . lover_album = { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Lover&quot;, &quot;artist&quot;: &quot;Taylor Swift&quot;, &quot;year&quot;: 2019, &quot;genre&quot;: [&quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Synth-pop&quot;], &quot;tracks&quot;: { 1: &quot;I Forgot That You Existed&quot;, 2: &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, 3: &quot;Lover&quot;, 4: &quot;The Man&quot;, 5: &quot;The Archer&quot;, 6: &quot;I Think He Knows&quot;, 7: &quot;Miss Americana &amp; The Heartbreak Prince&quot;, 8: &quot;Paper Rings&quot;, 9: &quot;Cornelia Street&quot;, 10: &quot;Death By A Thousand Cuts&quot;, 11: &quot;London Boy&quot;, 12: &quot;Soon You&#39;ll Get Better (feat.

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . To make their code as efficient as possible | Make their code simpler | . Take a look at our lassen volcano example from the data compression tech talk. The first code block is the original image. In the second code block, change the baseWidth to rescale the image. . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: lassen_volcano = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}]) image_display(lassen_volcano) . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path from PIL import Image as pilImage from io import BytesIO import base64 # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def scale_image(img): #baseWidth = 625 #baseWidth = 1250 #baseWidth = 2500 baseWidth = 200 # see the effect of doubling or halfing the baseWidth #baseWidth = 10000 #baseWidth = 20000 #baseWidth = 40000 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;width&#39;], image[&#39;height&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;pixels&#39;] = image[&#39;width&#39;] * image[&#39;height&#39;] # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;scaled_width&#39;], image[&#39;scaled_height&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;scaled_pixels&#39;] = image[&#39;scaled_width&#39;] * image[&#39;scaled_height&#39;] # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Use numpy to concatenate two arrays images = image_data(images = [{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}]) # Display meta data, scaled view, and grey scale for each image for image in images: image_management(image) print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(image[&#39;label&#39;]) print(image[&#39;source&#39;]) print(image[&#39;format&#39;]) print(image[&#39;mode&#39;]) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, image[&#39;size&#39;], &quot; pixels: &quot;, f&quot;{image[&#39;pixels&#39;]:,}&quot;) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;], &quot; pixels: &quot;, f&quot;{image[&#39;scaled_pixels&#39;]:,}&quot;) print(&quot;-- original image --&quot;) display(HTML(image[&#39;html&#39;])) . - meta data -- Lassen Volcano Peter Carolin JPEG RGB Original size: (2792, 2094) pixels: 5,846,448 Scaled size: (200, 150) pixels: 30,000 -- original image -- . Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . BOTH | Space:It takes up a lot of pixels on the computer screen- Time: It takes a really long time for the computer to generate a picture | . Big O Notation . Constant O(1) | Linear O(n) | Quadratic O(n^2) | Logarithmic O(logn) | Exponential (O(2^n)) | . numbers = list(range(1000)) print(numbers) . Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) . Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) print(fibonacci(30)) #print(fibonacci(40)) . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) print(generate_subsets([1,2,3,4,5,6])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) .

Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. | Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. | . Bubble Sort: It is one of the simplest sorting algorithms, where each element is compared with its adjacent element and swapped if the adjacent element is greater. This process is repeated until the list is sorted. The time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm is O(n^2). . | Selection Sort: First, the smallest element in the list is found and swapped with the first element. Then, the smallest element in the remaining list is found and swapped with the second element, and so on. The time complexity of the selection sort algorithm is O(n^2). . | Insertion Sort: This algorithm works by iterating through the list and inserting each element into its proper position in the sorted sub-list. The time complexity of the insertion sort algorithm is also O(n^2). . | Merge Sort: This algorithm divides the list into two halves recursively until each sub-list contains only one element. Then, the sub-lists are merged back together in sorted order. The time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n log n). . | Quick Sort: It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the list into two sub-lists, one with elements smaller than the pivot and the other with elements greater than the pivot. This process is repeated recursively until the list is sorted. The time complexity of the quick sort algorithm is O(n log n). . | Heap Sort: This algorithm sorts the elements by constructing a binary heap and repeatedly extracting the maximum element from the heap until the list is sorted. The time complexity of the heap sort algorithm is also O(n log n). . | Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? | . Time and Space complexity is important when choosing an algorithm because they are both two major factors that can effect the efficiency and readability of code. Especially for larger code projects, people want to code something that is easy to read and something that takes up the least amount of time. . Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain. | . It&#39;s not always necessary to use a constant time algorithm. Not every code cell is trying to accomplish the same thing, so the choice of algorithm depends on the specific problem you are trying to solve, the size of the input data, and the resources available to you. If you have a small input size and limited resources, a constant time algorithm might be the most efficient choice. But if your input size is large, it might not be possible to solve the problem with a constant time algorithm, and you might have to resort to an algorithm with higher time complexity, such as an exponential time algorithm. . What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? . Recursive calls: If an algorithm is recursive, the time complexity is often expressed using a recurrence relation. The complexity of a recursive algorithm is usually related to the number of recursive calls and the size of the data being processed. . | Sorting and searching: If an algorithm involves sorting or searching data, the time complexity is usually expressed in terms of the number of elements being sorted or searched. For example, quicksort and merge sort have a time complexity of O(n log n), while linear search has a time complexity of O(n). . | Data structures: If an algorithm uses data structures like arrays, lists, or trees, the space complexity is usually proportional to the size of the data being stored. For example, an algorithm that creates an array of size n has a space complexity of O(n). . | . | . Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below. Practice . Time and Space Complexity Analysis Questions . a = 0 b = 0 for i in range(N): a = a + random() for i in range(M): b= b + random() # Options: # O(N * M) time, O(1) space # O(N + M) time, O(N + M) space # O(N + M) time, O(1) space # O(N * M) time, O(N + M) space . O(N + M) time, O(1) space is the answer. Since N and M are independent variables, we can’t say which one is the leading tere. This would make the time complexity of this code would be O(M+N). Since variable size isn&#39;t determined by input size, our space complexity would remain constant or O(1) . a = 0 for i in range(N): for j in reversed(range(i,N)): a = a + i + j # Options # O(N) # O(N*log(N)) # O(N * Sqrt(N)) # O(N*N) . O(N*N) is the answer. There are two nested loops that both repeat the same collection. This means that the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadruples with the size of the collection. . k = 0 for i in range(n//2,n): for j in range(2,n,pow(2,j)): k = k + n / 2 # Options # O(n) # O(N log N) # O(n^2) # O(n^2Logn) . O(N log N) is the answer. The first for statement is N. The second for statement is logN. pow(2,j) represents the step size so for each iteration of the second for, j increases until 2^j = n which means that j = log(2)n. Then it stops so the time complexity is N*logN. . What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y? . X will always be a better choice for small inputs | X will always be a better choice for large inputs | Y will always be a better choice for small inputs | X will always be a better choice for all inputs | The answer is 2. The worst-case time complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the largest amount of time it takes to run for any input size n. When we say that algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than algorithm Y, we mean that X has a smaller worst-case time complexity than Y. This implies that as the input size increases towards infinity, X will eventually become faster than Y for large enough inputs. . a = 0 i = N while (i &gt; 0): a += i i //= 2 #Options #O(N) # O(Sqrt(N)) # O(N / 2) # O(log N) . O(log N) is the answer. We have to find the smallest x such that ‘(N / 2^x )&lt; 1 OR 2^x &gt; N’ x = log(N) . Which of the following best describes the useful criterion for comparing the efficiency of algorithms? | Time | Memory | Both of the above | None of the above | . The answer is 3. Comparing the efficiency of an algorithm depends on the time and memory taken by an algorithm. The algorithm which runs in lesser time and takes less memory even for a large input size is considered a more efficient algorithm. . How is time complexity measured? | By counting the number of algorithms in an algorithm. | By counting the number of primitive operations performed by the algorithm on a given input size. | By counting the size of data input to the algorithm. | None of the above | . The answer is 2. To determine the time complexity of an algorithm, we first identify the operations that the algorithm performs, and then we count the number of times each operation is executed as a function of the input size n. . for i in range(n): i=i*k # Options # O(n) # O(k) # O(logkn) # O(lognk) . The answer is O(logkn). Because loops for the kn-1 times, so after taking log it becomes logkn. . value = 0; for i in range(n): for j in range(i): value=value+1 # Options #n # (n+1) # n(n-1) # n(n+1) . The answer is n(n-1). First for loop will run for (n) times and another for loop will be run for (n-1) times as the inner loop will only run till the range i which is 1 less than n , so overall time will be n(n-1). . Algorithm A and B have a worst-case running time of O(n) and O(logn), respectively. Therefore, algorithm B always runs faster than algorithm A. | True | False | . The answer is false. The Big-O notation provides an asymptotic comparison in the running time of algorithms. For n &lt; n0​​, algorithm A might run faster than algorithm B, for instance. .",

            "content": "Overall score . . Test Corrections . Question 10: What I answered: A, Public key encryption is widely used because of the functionality it provides in addressing cybersecurity issues when sending information across the Internet. The correct answer: C, As an email message passes through the Internet, it goes through intermediate computers and routers. These computers and routers could read the contents of the email. The credit card number could be read from the email. . Question 13: What I answered: D, Statement III indicates that it would be better for the author to use a Creative Commons license because the author wants to allow permission to use and modify the e-book. The correct answer: C, Statement I is correct because the Creative Commons license is designed to increase the amount of content available to the public for free. Statement III is correct because under Creative Commons the author can stipulate what kind of modification is allowed by users. . Question 17: What I answered: C, Both online newspapers and social media sites make information widely accessible. The correct answer: B, Online newspapers are usually run out in the open, in that the people who create the newspaper are clearly noted on the website. In addition, these online newspapers are often connected to physical newspapers, which are considered credible sources of information. . Question 19: What I answered: A, The resultList contains only items from inputList1 that are also found in inputList2. The correct answer: B, Each item in inputList1 is checked to see if it appears in inputList2. If the item appears in inputList2, the item is appended to resultList. Since resultList is initially empty, at the end of the FOR EACH loop resultList will contain precisely the elements that appear in both initial lists. . Question 26: What I answered: B, With this algorithm, it is possible that the same student will be selected twice instead of 2 different students being selected. The correct answer: D, This algorithm selects 1 student from the group of 30 students, then selects another student from the remaining 29 students. Any possible pair of students is equally likely to be selected. . Question 29: What I answered: C, The fourth statement assigns the value false to a. The fifth statement assigns the value false to c. The correct answer: B, The first three statements assign values to the variables. The fourth statement assigns the value of (NOT (a OR b)) AND c to a. Since a OR b is true, NOT (a OR b) is false, so (NOT (a OR b)) AND c is false. The fifth statement assigns the value of c AND a to c. Since a is now false, c AND a is false. The last three statements display the values of the variables. . Question 31: What I answered: B, This algorithm will turn on the motor in some cases when the gate is already open. The correct answer: D, The algorithm continues past the first check if the time is during business hours, the algorithm continues past the second check if the gate sensor is activated, and the algorithm continues past the third check if the gate is not open. Performing the checks in this order will ensure that the gate is opened only under the appropriate conditions. . Question 33: What I answered: D, This code segment leaves the robot four rows above its starting position and two rows above the gray square. The correct answer: B, The loop that repeats four times returns the robot to its starting position. The three lines of code that follow the loop move the robot one row up and leave it facing right. When this has been repeated twice, the robot is in the gray square. . Question 37: What I answered: A, The value “ONE” is displayed only when x is greater than 10 and y is less than 10. For example, “ONE” will be displayed if x is 15 and y is 5. The correct answer: C, The value “THREE” is displayed whenever x is less than or equal to 10 and y is greater than 3. . Question 38: What I answered: A, The given code segment displays “positive” when num is positive, displays “negative” when num is negative, and displays “zero” when num is 0. This code segment does not produce the same result for all values of num. For example, “positive zero” is displayed when num is 0. The correct answer: B, The given code segment displays “positive” when num is positive, displays “negative” when num is negative, and displays “zero” when num is 0. This code segment produces the same result. When num is negative, “negative” is displayed. Otherwise, when num is 0, “zero” is displayed. Otherwise, “positive” is displayed. . Question 44: What I answered: A, The first call to printArgs displays two asterisks, not one. The second call to printArgs displays one asterisk, not two. The correct answer: B, The first call to printArgs displays the number 1, followed by the string “*”, followed by the number 1. The second call to printArgs displays the number 2, followed by the string “”, followed by the number 2. . Question 50: What I answered: B &amp; C The correct answer: A &amp; D .",

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

AP Prep . In blog add College Board practice problems for 2.3. . Q1: A researcher is analyzing data about students in a school district to determine whether there is a relationship between grade point average and number of absences. The researcher plans on compiling data from several sources to create a record for each student. Upon compiling the data, the researcher identifies a problem due to the fact that neither data source uses a unique ID number for each student. Which of the following best describes the problem caused by the lack of unique ID numbers? . Students who have the same name may be confused with each other. A unique identifier would be required in order to distinguish between two students with the same first and last names. . Q2: A team of researchers wants to create a program to analyze the amount of pollution reported in roughly 3,000 counties across the United States. The program is intended to combine county data sets and then process the data. Which of the following is most likely to be a challenge in creating the program? . Different counties may organize data in different ways. It will be a challenge to clean the data from the different counties to make the data uniform. The way pollution data is captured and organized may vary significantly from county to county. . Q3: A student is creating a Web site that is intended to display information about a city based on a city name that a user enters in a text field. Which of the following are likely to be challenges associated with processing city names that users might provide as input? . Users might enter abbreviations for the names of cities or Users might misspell the name of the city. Different users may abbreviate city names differently. This may require the student to clean the data to make it uniform before it can be processed. . Q4: A database of information about shows at a concert venue contains the following information: Name of artist performing at the show, Date of show, Total dollar amount of all tickets sold. Which of the following additional pieces of information would be most useful in determining the artist with the greatest attendance during a particular month? . Average ticket price. This makes sense because if an artist&#39;s ticket cost more, they are considered more valuable, and the reason why a person might be considered more valuable is because they are more popular. . Q5: A camera mounted on the dashboard of a car captures an image of the view from the driver’s seat every second. Each image is stored as data. Along with each image, the camera also captures and stores the car’s speed, the date and time, and the car’s GPS location as metadata. Which of the following can best be determined using only the data and none of the metadata? . The number of bicycles the car passed on a particular day. Determining the number of bicycles the car encountered would require the use of image recognition software to examine the images collected by the camera. The images are the data collected and no metadata would be required. . Q6: A teacher sends students an anonymous survey in order to learn more about the students’ work habits. The survey contains the following questions. Which of the following questions about the students who responded to the survey can the teacher answer by analyzing the survey results? . Do students who enjoy the subject material tend to spend more time on homework each night than the other students do? Do students who spend more time on homework each night tend to spend less time studying for tests than the other students do? Do students who spend more time studying for tests tend to earn higher grades in the class than the other students do? . 1 and 2. The survey questions collect data on how much students enjoy a subject and how many hours they spend on hw and studying. As a result, putting together the data will give information about correlation between liking a subject and spending more time on hw (or any other combo). However, the data does not account for what type of student earns higher grades .",

Some of the big ideas and vocab that you observe, talk about it with a partner ... . &quot;Data compression is the reduction of the number of bits needed to represent data&quot; | &quot;Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space.&quot; | &quot;lossy data can reduce data but the original data is not recovered&quot; | &quot;lossless data lets you restore and recover&quot; | . The Image Lab Project contains a plethora of College Board Unit 2 data concepts. Working with Images provides many opportunities for compression and analyzing size. . Image Files and Size . Here are some Images Files. Download these files, load them into images directory under _notebooks in your Blog. . Clouds Impression | Lassen Volcano | Green Square | . Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ... . File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab | Size, height and width, number of pixels | Visual perception, lossy compression | . Displaying images in Python Jupyter notebook . Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories . IPython . Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks. Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? | What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? | What are some of the major differences? | . Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. . Why is path a big deal when working with images? | How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? | Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? | . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) # Run this as standalone tester to see sample data printed in Jupyter terminal if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # print parameter supplied image green_square = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}]) image_display(green_square) # display default images from image_data() default_images = image_data() image_display(default_images) . Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. | . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? | How do these effects apply to images? | . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. .

AP Prep . In blog add College Board practice problems for 2.2 . Q1: Which of the following is an advantage of a lossless compression algorithm over a lossy compression algorithm? . A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee reconstruction of original data, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot. This is correct because lossless compression algorithms are guaranteed to be able to reconstruct the original data, while lossy compression algorithms are not. . Q2: A user wants to save a data file on an online storage site. The user wants to reduce the size of the file, if possible, and wants to be able to completely restore the file to its original version. Which of the following actions best supports the user’s needs? . Compressing the file using a lossless compression algorithm before uploading it. This is correct because lossless compression algorithms allow for complete reconstruction of the original data and typically reduce the size of the data. . Q3: A programmer is developing software for a social media platform. The programmer is planning to use compression when users send attachments to other users. Which of the following is a true statement about the use of compression? . Lossy compression of an image file generally provides a greater reduction in transmission time than lossless compression does.This is correct because since lossy data is unable to allow for complete reconstruction of the original data, that means less bits or packets(not sure of the exact term) are sent. Less data being transferred logically means that there is a reduction in transmission time. . Choose 2 images, one that will more likely result in lossy data compression and one that is more likely to result in lossless data compression. Explain. .",

Should it be corrected? Is it good business? Facebook: 25-34, TikTok: 10-19 I think that there is exclusion between the platforms but that is mostly due to a generation gap. I don’t think it’s very harmful at all because it’s a natural divide. It definitely is good business because each individual company caters to their target audience . Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? Virtual assistants have female voices because it’s more pleasing to hear and easier to understand. It may also be connected to the submissive nature of virtual assistants. I think it’s a little harmful because it promotes bias that women are viewed as assistants and can be corrected by assigning a gender neutral voice. It is good business though, because it caters to most humans’s preferences. . Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google) One algorithm that influences a lot of people’s lives is the TikTok algorithm. There are many trends that spread because of it, which influences real world actions. This can be both harmful and beneficial. Companies like Instagram and Facebook will feed you content that will keep you on their site longer, which would make them more ad revenue. . Pair work (Video on HP computers are racist) . Q1: Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? A1: It’s hard to tell, but he seems to be jokingly upset at the computer for not recognizing him for his skin color. . Q2: How do you think this happened? A2: I think it was because of the bad lighting in the video. Additionally, the face recognition program may have been trained on people with lighter skin. . Q3: Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? A3: Yes, it is harmful because it excludes a large group of people. I don’t think it was intended to be harmful because that would be bad business. . Q4: Should it be corrected? A4: Yes. . Q5: What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? A5: Train the facial recognition program with darker skin color. . 5.4 Crowd Sourcing . Group work ~10 min Q1: We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API’s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used. A1: I have used an API with symptoms including cough, fever, etc. I used this in my tri1 project. Our crossover team used a Wikipedia API. . Q2: We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub? A2: he biggest discovery I’ve found on GitHub is GitHub.dev. It allows you to look at peoples code and it’s format through the web. . Q3: Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20. Did you see anything interesting? A3: here is a lot of medical apis, car apis, covid data, election results, and even arrests in the city of Chicago. . Q4: CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsourcing idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? A4: I think slack is in a sense apcsps form of crowd sourcing. Important information is sent there and people can ask questions and get answers on the slack as well . Q5: What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? A5: Del Norte definitely needs better crowd sourcing. Currently, a lot of decisions made by the school are done by the staff or ASB, however regular students don’t really have a chance to say much. I think making a board of students could help with this problem. These students could get feedback from classes and then give that input to those who make final decisions. . Q6: What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. A6: I could make a google form, but to make it more csp related, I could set up a SQLite database to collect feedback from every student who stops to see the project. This feedback would all be collected in one place. . 5.5 Legal and Ethical Courses . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal: The Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication waives copyright interest in a work you’ve created and dedicates it to the world-wide public domain Open Source GPL License: The GNU GPLv3 also lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions. Open Source MIT License: This allows using code freely and making and distributing closed source versions. Typically, the author of software with MIT License want credit. Credit could be as simple as adding the authors name in comments. . | In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. There are open source and closed source licenses. Open source licenses force companies or individuals to have their code be public and closed source allows the code to be kept private. Some of these licenses prevent distribution of closed source versions of their work. Digital rights are software to protect, play, and/or distribute content. An example of digital rights are the terms of service that you often have to agree to before purchasing something. I have subscriptions to things like Netflix and Youtube that allow me to have privileges to view or listen to different content. However, there are some ways to bypass these digital rights such as through illegal websites.In terms of ethics, many people want to bypass digital rights through illegal website but by doing this the artists and owners of the content don’t get paid for their work, instead people can view it for free. This can have a negative impact on the income of those people. . | Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. The GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users, which is why I choose it. . | 5.6 Safe Computing . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. In our project, we have a user login and sign-up system which requires the users email as well as a password of their choice. . | What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? I believe that some PII will inevitably be out there for everyone to see but it’s crucial that more risky information like passwords and personal credentials stay to oneself. I have PII that I put on the internet. Specifically, Iuse instagram and linkedin where I have my name, accomplishments, etc. listed. . | Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication? A bad password is one that has no system of authentication. Symmetric encryption is not a good system for passwords as it is a type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic information. A good password has a system of authentication. They use Multi-factor authentication which often requires you to enter a code that has been texted or emailed to you. Another good method is Asymmetric cryptography. Asymmetric cryptography, aka public-key cryptography, is a process that uses a pair of related keys – one public key and one private key – to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it from unauthorized access or use. . | Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption is not a good system for passwords as it is a type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic information. Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, is a process that uses a pair of related keys – one public key and one private key – to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it from unauthorized access or use. We did this for the security of our fastpages site, using a public and private key . | Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. . | Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. I would occasionaly recieve dms from my friends on discord with a link to “free nitro” but in reality the link gets you to fil out personal information which it then uses to hack your discord account. Unfortunately, Ive had this happen to me due to my lack of knowledge on safe computing. Now that I know this is a way to hack any account, I will not fall into this trap again :). . |",

Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing Pros: Computing helps us become more informed with news that we may not know from commmunicating with other people | Computers have a very efficient way to organize and store data like photos, notes from class and important files so that it is still easy to access yet kept in a safe space | Computing helps improve quality of life to help make our lives easier and more efficient like copy and paste, where rather than typing the same thing over and over again you can use ctrl-c and ctrl-v to do the same thing in a shorter amount of time | . | Cons: . Computers can cause people to spend too much time sitting down and looking at a screen. This can have bad long term affects on ones eyesight and physical health. It can also effect a person’s social life because they can become addicted to a screen. | Not all computing technology is used to good intentions, like how the military may use their access to technology to hack into another country’s server | There is a digital divide, where people who may not be able to afford electronics may feel disconnected and left out from opportunities from people who have access to technology | . Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? I use my computer for many reasons: school, homework, extracurriculars, communicating with peers, etc. Sometimes when I lose track of time, I spend the whole day in front of a computer screen, either being productive or wasting time. I could either have a lot of homework that needs to be done or I could be bingewatching my favorite show. Because the computer gives me access to almost let me do anything I want, I can easily get distracted from a Youtube video or online shopping, which can cause me to procrasinate. Yet again, my computer is also used for productivity, where I can do my research for my English paper or go on Khan Academy to learn a new skill to further develop my knowledge on my academics. | CTP Questions . Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit Helps people make an informed decision about what type of car they are looking to buy. Users can gain specific information on the type, model, mileage, and price of a car. | Helps people save time when buying a car. Instead of having to spend hours going from car dealer to car dealer asking questions about a car, the user can find all the information they need in one place on one website. | Since our project has a sign up and log in feature, this means that users can “save” cars their account and refer beck to them by logging in to the website again. This feature makes looking for information easy and fast. | . | Think of a potential harmful effect of your project. I think that our website could potentially be a disruptor in how people look for a car to buy. Instead of seeing the car in person, the user might base their purchase only on what they see online but when they actually get the car, it isn’t what they were anticipating. This can create some false expectations which wouldn’t be good for someone trying to make an important purchase. . | What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. Its obviously very upsetting that digital divide is something that exists. I think its very unfair that not everyone has access to the same opportunities and education, something that is partially effected by the digital divide. Those who do not have computers lose access to the internet and all the information that comes with it. As a result, they fall behind other, not because they lack the skill, but because they lack the resources which is extremely unfair. Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? Pros Cons prevents students from getting distracted (ex: games, youtube, instagram etc.). could block websites and videos that are actually informational and needed during classroom work-time This creates a bias against what should and should not be filtered. Some content that is actually purposeful and informational might get blocked just because of it’s source which is considered “bad” students don’t have access to good internet which can impair the quality of learning | For collegeboard mc, I got a 44/50 . Q06 . I chose C, The expression (num MOD 2) will compute the remainder when num is divided by 2. This code fragment will display “odd” when num is even, which is the opposite of its intended behavior. . Q12 . I chose “(onFloor1 AND callTo2) AND (onFloor2 AND callTo1)” but the answer was “(onFloor1 OR callTo2) AND (onFloor2 AND callTo1)” Notes I overlooked the fact that there were two answers that were the same, the only difference being that one was AND and the other OR. In both the ways that the answer calls the function, the elevator will be able to move which is why the correct answer is “OR” . Q26 . I picked D, which had the robot in the center of the grid facing up. Although this is a possible location for the robot to end up in, it wasn’t facing in the correct direction. The robot should have been facing downward. Therefore, the correct answer is A, which has the robot in the center of the 5th row on the grid, facing to the left. . Q27 . I had chosen option C.This algorithm is wrong, however. This is because the function get messed up since the n = n+1 is set at the beginning, therefore, the “repeat n times” function will mess the code up from the beginning. Therefore, option D is correct because it sets the n = n+1 at the end of the algorithm. . Q28 . I selected answer B which was wrong because with each iteration of the Repeat 4 times loop, the robot will move two squares to the left and will remain facing up. On the third iteration of this loop, the robot will attempt to move to a square that is beyond the edge of the grid. At this point, the robot will stay in the lower-left square and the program will then stop. That is not supposed to happen. Therefore, the answers are A and C, both of which correctly execute what needed to be done. For A, each iteration of the Repeat 4 times loop, allows the robot to move one square to the left and one square up and will remain facing up. After four of these iterations, the robot will finish in the gray square. For C, after one iteration of the Repeat 2 times loop, the robot will end up in the upper-right square facing to the left. After the second iteration of the Repeat 2 times loop, the robot will end up in the upper-left square facing down. Both od these result in the robot ending in the gray square. . Q30 . For this one, I selected only one answer because I read the question wrong. It asked for 2 answers. I don’t know why I selected A which drew the circle before anything was defined in the program. I think that was a silly error on my part. I was probably getting confused with answer choice C which defined different numbers to x y and r. . Overall Thoughts/ Reflection . Now to improve my CollegeBoard MCQ Test Scores I want to focus on getting better at looking at pseudo code segments and correctly identifying their errors, function, and improvements that can be made. . CPT OUTLINE . Program Purpose and Function . In my video, I will demonstrate filling out the multiple choice questionnaire (input). Once I hit submit, it will show the output, which will be the model name (and possibly an image) of the best fit chevrolet car for the user. . Written Response: . Function: A questionnarie on a website which recommends a chevrolet vehicle that would best match with a user’s transportational needs . Purpose: To help people who are trying to buy a new car find the chevrolet car model which best meets their needs. This helps people save time when they’re trying to buy a new car, and also to be prepared when they visit the dealership. . Input: user answering car search tool questionnaire on frontend . Output: car recommendation . Data Abstraction . Code segment which shows that data is being stored in a list: create array with quiz questions and iterate through them . Code segment which shows the data in the same list being used as a part of fulfilling the program’s purpose: loop through questions –&gt; if user’s answer marches with a product’s assigned answer –&gt; add one point to that car model, just like a quiz assigning points to a student . Identify name of variable representing list being used: TBD . Describes what the data contained in this list is representing in the program: the data contained in the list will be the questions that the users will be asked and the answer sets that go along with them to determine which chevrolet car recommendation they’ll get . Managing Complexity . Explains how the list manages complexity, how the program would be different without the use of the list, and why I need it for my program: If I use a list to store the data for questions and the user’s answers, it will be easier for the program to come up with a result for the car recommendation by adding up points for each car and then choosing the car which is the best fit for them Procedural Abstraction Code segment that shows a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure: Create function that adds points to the cars which match with the user’s input –&gt; whichever car has the most points will be printed as the best fit match –&gt; works like a graded quiz, kind of . Show a code segment where the student-develop procedure is being called: show a place where my quiz point adder will be called . Describes what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program: The procedure essentially finds the car in the list which is the best match for the user. Without the procedure, the program would not be able to find a best fit car for the user . Algorithm Implementation . Code segment in student-developed procedure shows sequencing, iteration, and selection . Explain in detail steps how the identified algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it: explain each step of the algorithm . Testing . One call to program . Question: “What type of car do you prefer” User Input: “Sedan” Condition: If loop, if user chooses “sedan,” add one point to all the variables for cars which are sedans Output: The car which is outputted will be a sedan Second call to program . Question: “What power source do you prefer” User Input: “Hybrid” Condition: If loop, if user chooses “hybrid,” add one point to all the variables for cars which are hybrid Output: The car which is outputted will be a hybrid sedan, using both of these calls to come up with the final result .",

The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A decidable is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An undecidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False .

The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1. Note that the computer runs forever. while i == 0: number += 1 if integerTest(number) == False: i +=1 print(&quot;Done&quot;) . The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an undecidable problem. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is no way to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the code runs forever, so HaltChecker returns an output of never. | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is halt. It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of never. | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem. Explain why it is considered an undecidable problem. . Dividing by zero is one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem because the output will always be undefined. . 3.17 Homework . Graph #1 https://github.com/sarahliu2006/Sarah-Liu/blob/cd94712c83033c2aa6cf192f340db6e83d2db5fa/images/graph0.PNG . Graph #2 https://github.com/sarahliu2006/Sarah-Liu/blob/cd94712c83033c2aa6cf192f340db6e83d2db5fa/images/graph1.PNG . The first graph appears to be more linear while the second graph resembles the graph of logn. The linear graph is always increasing, meaning that the bigger your number is, the longer it takes to identify your number. However, in the second graph, while the curve does increase, it increases slower than the linear one. This means that as the range of a list of numbers increases, the linear graph shows that time will increase more steeply than the graph of logn. Hence lists with more numbers will take less time for the logn graph vs the linear graph because the logn graph makes it so that time increases in very small increments. Therefore, second graph is more efficient. In addition, the points of the first graph are calculated using linear search which iterates through each number in the list one by one until it identifies the number. On the other hand, the second graph&#39;s points are calculated using binary search. Binary search cuts the list in half each time, repeating this process until your number is found. Therefore, binary search is much faster than linear search, hence the second graph is much more efficient. . import time def linear_search(lst, x): start_time = time.perf_counter_ns() # records time (nanoseconds) for i in range(len(lst)): # loops through the entire list if lst[i] == x: # until the x value we are looking for is found end_time = time.perf_counter_ns() # records time again total_time = (end_time - start_time) // 1000 # subtracts last recorded time and first recorded time print(&quot;Found element after {} loops in {} microseconds&quot;.format(i+1, total_time)) # prints the results return print(&quot;Your number was found at&quot;, i) end_time = time.perf_counter_ns() # records the time again total_time = (end_time - start_time) // 1000 # subtracts last recorded time and first recorded time print(&quot;Element not found after {} loops in {} microseconds&quot;.format(len(lst), total_time)) # prints the results return &quot;Your number wasn&#39;t found :(&quot; lst = list(range(1, 10001)) # list with numbers 1-10000 x = 1000 # replace with an integer between 1 and 10000 (I suggest big numbers like 500, 2000, so on) linear_search(lst, x) # runs procedure .

Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks . | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. . | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) . | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. . | . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? . It&#39;s too hot outside! . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then Input 95, what do you notice? . It&#39;s too hot outside! Sure I will play outside! . Conditionals vs. Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. .

Flowcharts . Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | Ex: see Example A . | . | . | Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Algorithm to Start (Determining Whether a Number is Even or Odd) . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx = int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) new = 0 while (new != 1): if (varx %2 == 0): new == varx / 2 print(&quot;your new number is: &quot; + str(new)) else: new == varx * 3 + 1 print(&quot;Your new number is &quot; + str(new)) . choose value for x the number is even .

Takeaways . You can use code you&#39;ve previously wrote in order to make a project easier. | Breaking algorithms down into steps can make things easier and more simple. | . Hacks . create another algorithm using a famous mathematical algorithm such as the &quot;collatz conjecture.&quot; and explain your steps in a post on a blog. | . 3.11 Binary Search . Goals/Objectives: . detirmine number of iterations required to find vlue in data set. | explain requirements for binary search | . What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . About Binary Search: . Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated. | In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order | COLLEGE BOARD INDEX STARTS AT 1 NOT 0 | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 4 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . Element is present at index 1 . We have created a function called binary_search() function which takes two arguments - a list to be sorted and a number to be searched. . | We have declared two variables to store the lowest and highest values in the list. The lowest is assigned initial value to 0, the highest to len(list1) 1 and mid as 0. . | Next, we have declared the while loop with the condition that the lowest is equal and smaller than the highest. The while loop will iterate if the number has not been found yet. . | In the while loop, we find the mid value and compare the index value to the number we are searching for. . | If the value of the mid-index is smaller than n, we increase the mid value by 1 and assign it to the low. The search moves to the left side. . | Otherwise, if the value of mid index is larger than n, we decrease the mid value by 1 and assign it to the high. The search moves to the right side. . | If the n is equal to the mid value then return mid. . | This will happen until the low is equal and smaller than the high. . | If we reach at the end of the function, then the element is not present in the list. We return -1 to the calling function. . | . . Hacks . Using my example above and steps below, create your own iteration using binary search . Steps . Compare x with the middle element. | If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index. | Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half. | Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half. | . def binary_search(arr, x): low = 0 high = len(arr)-1 mid = 0 if low&lt;=high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer part if x == arr[mid]: return mid elif x &lt; arr[mid]: high = mid - 1 return high else: low = mid + 1 return low else: return -1 arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11] x = 11 result = binary_search(arr, x) if result != -1: print(&quot;Found at position : &quot;,str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not in the array!&quot;) . Found at position : 6 . Homework Assignment (DUE FRIDAY 12/09 BY 5:00 PM) . Consider this situation: . You&#39;re playing a short game using a random number generator from 1 to 20 .

            "content": "Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequencial execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | . Slide 3: . Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. | The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. | Convert the following psuedocode to python | . def convertFahrenheit(temperature): celsius = temperature - 32 celsius = celsius * 0.56 return celsius outsideTemp = input(&quot;what is the temperature outside?&quot;) outsideTemp = (convertFahrenheit(int(outsideTemp))) print(outsideTemp) . -6.720000000000001 . Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. . What would be a good name for this procedure? | What parameters do we need for this procedure? | Try writing this procedure out in python based on the given pseudocode | . quizGrade = 32 def currentGrade(currentPoints): currentGrade = currentPoints / 40 currentGrade = currentGrade * 100 return currentGrade newPoints = int(input(&quot;how many points do you currently have?&quot;)) newPercent = (currentGrade(int(newPoints))) if (newPoints &gt; quizGrade): newquizGrade = newPercent print(&quot;your new grade is: &quot; + str(newquizGrade)) else: print(&quot;your score is still &quot; + str(quizGrade)) . your score is still 32 . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity | A procedural abstraction may abstract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a prewritten procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial | . Complexity Example . One of the biggest advantages of procedural abstraction is managing complexity. . Think about the process of simplifying the code? What do you think the advantage of the code segment on the left is? . Code Segment 1 Code Segment 2 . ROTATE_LEFT() | detourLeft() | .

Question 1: What I answered: A, The code segment displays the value of 2(5×3) by initializing result to 2 and then multiplying result by 3 a total of five times. The correct answer: D, The code segment displays the value of 2(5^3) by initializing result to 2 and then multiplying result by 5 a total of three times. The code segment initializes result to 2, then repeatedly multiplies result by 5 inside a loop. . Question 5: What I answered: C, II and III only. Information about which restaurants Brandon and Cynthia have visited in the past is not needed. Restaurants are recommended based on whether they can accommodate all allergies and dietary restrictions, not based on whether group members have been there before. The correct answer: B, III only. Brandon’s contact list is not needed. Alejandra is organizing the meal, so the group members are selected from her contact list, not Brandon’s. Information about which restaurants Brandon and Cynthia have visited in the past is not needed. Restaurants are recommended based on whether they can accommodate all allergies and dietary restrictions, not based on whether group members have been there before. Information about which food allergies and dietary restrictions can be accommodated at nearby restaurants is needed so that a restaurant can be recommended for the group. . Question 14: What I answered: 6 and 7. 6 is correct, but 7 is not because when numCorrect is 7, the condition numCorrect &gt; 7 evaluates to false. Therefore “check” is displayed as intended. The correct answer: 6 and 8. When numCorrect is 6, the condition numCorrect &gt; 7 evaluates to false. Therefore “check” is displayed instead of the intended “check minus”. When numCorrect is 8, the condition numCorrect &gt; 7 evaluates to true and the condition numCorrect ≥ 9 evaluates to false. Therefore “check minus” is displayed instead of the intended “check plus”. . Question 16: What I answered: A, The message is broken into packets that are transmitted in a specified order. Each packet must be received in the order it was sent for the message to be correctly reassembled by the recipient’s device. Messages are broken into packets, but they can be received in any order and still be reassembled. The correct answer: B, The message is broken into packets. The packets can be received in any order and still be reassembled by the recipient’s device. Messages are broken into packets. Each packet contains data to be transmitted, as well as metadata for routing and reassembling the data upon receipt. This allows the packets to be received in any order and still be reassembled correctly. . Question 23: What I answered: A, The position of the runner is determined by calculating the time difference between the start and the end of the race and making an estimation based on the runner’s average speed. While a runner’s position could be estimated using the runner’s average speed, a more accurate representation of the position over time can be achieved using a sampling technique. The correct answer: D, The position of the runner is sampled at regular intervals to approximate the real-word position, and a sequence of bits is used to represent each sample. Analog data, like the runner’s position, have values that change smoothly, rather than in discrete intervals. Analog data can be approximated digitally by measuring values of the analog signal at regular intervals called samples. The samples are represented digitally as sequences of bits. . Question 26: What I answered: C, string. A string could be used to indicate whether a store is open (for example, by letting “open” represent open and “closed” represent closed). The correct answer: A, Boolean. The status of whether a store is open can be represented using only the values true and false, so a Boolean variable is most appropriate. . Question 28: What I answered: D, This code incorrectly charges customers who use more than 25 units of electricity. These customers are charged $7 for each of the first 25 units and $5 for each subsequent unit. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. This code segment would incorrectly charge the customer 25 * $7 + 7 * $5 = $210 for the 32 units. The correct answer: C, If the number of units of electricity used is 25 or less, the cost is 5 times the number of units. Otherwise, the cost is 5 times the first 25 units plus 7 times the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. . Question 35: What I answered: B, The last line in this code segment sets maxPS to 50 regardless of the value of time. The correct answer: D, This code segment uses the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time &gt; 120 and uses the ELSE statement to set maxPS to 50 otherwise. . Question 36: What I answered: A, APPEND(evenList, i) i ← i + 2. This would be the correct solution if i were initialized to 2 instead of 1. This code segment will generate the list [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]. The correct answer: C, APPEND(evenList, 2 * i) i ← i + 1. For the first iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 2, is appended to evenList, and then i is incremented to 2. For the second iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 4, is appended to the list, and then i is incremented to 3. This continues eight more times, appending the next eight even numbers to evenList. This code segment will generate the list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]. . Quesiton 37: What I answered: B, This code segment assigns both variables the original value of num1. The correct answer: D, The first statement assigns the value of num1 to the temporary variable temp. The second statement assigns the value of num2 to num1. The third statement assigns the original value of num1, which is stored in temp, to num2. The original values of num1 to num2 are interchanged. . Question 38: What I answered: A, temp ← word1 word3 ← word1 word1 ← temp. This code segment assigns “xylophone” to both word1 and word3. The correct answer: B, temp ← word1 word1 ← word3 word3 ← temp. The first statement assigns the value of word1 to the temporary variable temp. The second statement assigns the value of word3 to word1. The third statement assigns the original value of word1, which is stored in temp, to word3. The original values of word1 and word3 are interchanged, which reverses the values of the variables as intended. . Question 42: What I answered: A, 12. After initially assigning values to the variables, the code segment assigns the value 4 to num3 and assigns the value 8 to num1. The correct answer: C, 16. The first three statements assign values to the variables. Since num1 &lt; num2 evaluates to false, the body of the ELSE block is executed and num3 is assigned the value 4. Since num2 ≥ num3 evaluates to true, the body of the second IF block is executed and num1 is assigned the value 8. Lastly, sum is assigned the value of 8 + 4 + 4, or 16. . Question 43: What I answered: A, 6. This is the value of x after the code segment is executed, not the value of result. The correct answer: B, 15. The variables x and result are initialized to 0. Inside the loop, result is increased by x and x is increased by 1. The loop terminates when x exceeds 5. Therefore, result is assigned the sum of the integers from 0 to 5, or 15. . Question 46: What I answered: C, The value of first is false, and the value of second is true. The fourth statement assigns the value of second (which is true) to first. The correct answer: A, The value of first is true, and the value of second is true. The first two statements assign values to the variables. The third statement assigns the value of first (which is true) to second. The fourth statement assigns the value of second (which is true) to first. .",

            "content": "Program Purpose and Function . Our program’s function is to help people with different illnesses identify their sickness by entering various symptoms (that we are pulling from a health API). The plan for the output is to give the user a simple diagnosis, and possibly methods and actions they should take going forward. We plan to further clarify the current confusion between COVID-19 symptoms and other common sickness symptoms. We hope to help those who are financially struggling and do not have access to a qualified doctor with a free algorithm that can serve as a diagnosis with generated advice for the user’s specific discomforts. . Data Abstraction . There will most likely be variables involved to make our code more organized and make the search easier. We plan to use loops and statements such as if, elif, for, and while loops to control our data extraction through time and other constraints. . Managing Complexity . Since we plan on using an API in our project, this means that we will be handling a lot of data, hence organization is required. We plan on doing this with lists and dictionaries to create and format our API in key-value pairs. This will be crucial to the function, organization, and efficiency of our project. In addition, by setting up a dictionary of lists, data can be pulled from the dictionary by creating an additional search, add, or delete function since each user who uses our project will need to register with the system we create. . Procedural Abstraction . We will create a search engine where the user can search for their symptoms and identify what sickness they have. The search engine will be able to narrow down the results of the different illnesses the user may have. To accomplish this task, we plan to make use of either AI sources to train and input data or create or use a general Rapid API database. . Algorithm Implementation . We are going to create a function that takes user inputs and compares them to a list of data that we have from the API. We will code the function to respond accordingly based on the user input. How is still to be determined . Testing . If we use an AI source, then we would have to input thousands of different varying from specifying symptoms, and random ones to train our AI and help it learn. Our other option is that after we create a flask website, and code our API sources program, we could use the input function to input different symptoms and see if the API or AI can decipher our symptoms and tell us the most likely illness that we have. .",

Using active recall to review what you have learned can help you remember the content much easier. . Code Explaination . I defined and set a variable, score, to 0. This will be used to calculate the user’s end score out of 5 since I have 5 questions and each question will be worth 1 point. | I set the screen to “homescreen”, this is where the game starts | When the user clicks the “start quiz” button, the app takes them to the first question screen. | For the first question the correct answer is Print Working Directory. Thus, if the user clicks Print Working Directory, 1 is added to the score variable. The next screen will say “You are correct! +1 points for you!” is shown and the screen takes 2 seconds to change to the next question. The screen then changes to the next question in 2 seconds. | If another answer choice was chosen, then the next screen will say “You are incorrect! No points for you!” and no points will be added to the score | The same process goes for all the other questions | Once the user answers the fifth question, the screen is taken to the results screen. However, because the score for each user is different, I set the “score_result” text to the variable score that has been accumulating the user’s amount of correct answers. | Successes . I was able to make the game easy to use so that the player won’t have difficulty understanding how to play the game | The overall aesthetic of the game is pleasing to look at, nothing that will make the player feel uneasy when playing the game | The game is user-friendly, there is a two second rest between questions and the words are easy to read | . Problems and their Solutions . I have never used App Lab before, so in the beginning it was pretty frustrating to use since I wasn’t sure how everything worked. .

            "content": "Sarah Liu . Ms. Darcey-Hall . Period 4 . 21 August 2022 . Rhetorical Precis . In the article “Op-Ed: We’re teaching kids to follow their dreams. Maybe teach them to be helpful instead”, Joel Stein stresses the difference between a figure who leads change rather than a figure who helps create change, that being someone who advocates and takes action is someone more helpful than one who is a leader of change. Stein develops his viewpoint using his son’s 4th grade class, where all the students had to choose a famous person to become in a “Living Wax Museum”. Through Stein’s observations, most of the students choose people that weren’t labeled as “problematic” or “evil”, but rather more “heroic”, even “virtuous”. He found this very infuriating because he found out that his son wanted to go as Nixon or Trump, “but was told that he had to pick a person who was admirable.” (Stein 4). This was even more angered when he saw a student dress up as Ghandi while also spreading false information about a man who wasn’t as heroic as textbooks say he was. Stein’s opinionful article reveals that exposing children to certain things will only prevent them to do greater things. His frustrated tone appeals to readers with interest in doing rather than leading. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .

Binary The study of encoding and decoding signals to ensure their security. Coding is done using a key that should ideally only be known by the message’s sender and intended receiver.One of the lowest levels of abstraction employs a base-2 numeric system that only uses combinations of the digits zero and one. In boolean logic, a single binary digit can stand in for True (1) or False (0), but many binary digits can be combined to store enormous amounts of data and carry out intricate operations. Computers convert between binary and the real data you need, such as numbers. | . def decimal_to_binary(n: int) -&gt; str: binary_digits = [] . while n &gt; 0: binary_digits.append(n % 2) n = n // 2 return &quot;&quot;.join(str(d) for d in binary_digits[::-1]) . Binary Search The study of encoding and decoding signals to ensure their security. Coding is done using a key that should ideally only be known by the message’s sender and intended receiver. It finds the location of a target value within a sorted array by continually halving the search interval. The amount of effort needed to discover an object rises considerably more slowly with Binary Search than with Sequential Search due to its divide-and-conquer strategy. | . def binary_search(arr: List[int], target: int) -&gt; int: low = 0 high = len(arr) - 1 . while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 if target &lt; arr[mid]: high = mid - 1 # Narrow the search range to the lower half elif target &gt; arr[mid]: low = mid + 1 # Narrow the search range to the upper half else: return mid # Return the index of the target element return -1 . Boolean Functionof libraries The study of encoding and decoding signals to ensure their security. Coding is done using a key that should ideally only be known by the message’s sender and intended receiver. Any function that is based on AND, OR, and NOT and whose constituent parts fall under the purview of boolean algebra or a function that takes values from a two-element set (often 0 and 1) for both its inputs and the function itself. | . def bool_func(x: bool, y: bool) -&gt; bool: if x and not y: return True else: return False . Cryptography The study of encoding and decoding signals to ensure their security.

Hexadecimal Integers can be positive, negative, or zero and are full numbers, not fractions. A datum of integral data type, or data type that represents a limited subset of the mathematical integers, is what is known as an integer in computer science. Different widths and the ability to include negative values are both options for integral data types. | . print(‘FF6699’) FF6699 . Integers An integer is a whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero and is not a fraction. A data type that represents a limited subset of the mathematical numbers is known as an integer in computer science. Different widths and the presence of negative values are also possible for integral data types. | . x = 10 print(x) # prints 10 print(type(x)) # prints &lt;class ‘int’&gt; . y = x + 5 print(y) # prints 15 z = x * y print(z) # prints 150 . Iterations The repetition of part of an algorithm until a condition is met or for a specified number of times. This is often called a ‘loop’. Recursive functions repeatedly execute themselves as part of their operation. Upon completing all instructions and resetting to the first one iteration has been completed. | . numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] for number in numbers: print(number) . words = [“apple”, “banana”, “cherry”] for word in words: print(word) . Libraries A collection of non-volatile data that a program may often access to create new software. They are helpful for storing frequently used functions. When the linker cannot find a procedure elsewhere, it automatically searches libraries for it. Data, documentation, message templates, pre-written code, classes, and values are examples of resources that may be found in libraries. | . import math x = math.sqrt(9) print(x) # prints 3.0 . y = math.sin(math.pi / 2) print(y) # prints 1.0 . import random . data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] random.choice(data) . Linear/Sequential Search A method that progressively examines each element in the list until the target element is discovered or every element has been examined. | . def linear_search(data, target): for i in range(len(data)): if data[i] == target: return i return -1 . data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] target = 3 . index = linear_search(data, target) . if index == -1: print(f”{target} not found in data”) else: print(f”{target} found at index {index}”) . Lossless Data Compression When a file is compressed without any loss of quality, all of the original data is still present when the file is decompress. The information has been fully recovered. This method is typically used for text or spreadsheet files where the loss of words or financial information might be problematic. A format for images that offers lossless compression is PNG. | . compressed_data = zlib.compress(data) decompressed_data = zlib.decompress(compressed_data) assert data == decompressed_data . Metadata Information about other information. Basic information about data is summarized in metadata, which can facilitate identifying and interacting with specific instances of data. It offers details on an item’s content, such as the size and resolution of the images. | . Sarah . Pseudocode A thorough yet understandable specification of what an algorithm or computer program must accomplish. It might also be used to define a working principle. Instead of being represented in a programming language made for humans, it is done so in a professionally stylized natural language. Normal programming practices continue. | . maxValue = 0 FOR each number in list: IF number &gt; maxValue: maxValue = number OUTPUT maxValue . Sequencing The process of carrying out each step/action in a particular algorithm in the exact sequence that is specified. | . def greet(name): print(“Hello, “ + name + “!”) . x = 5 . print(x) . greet(“Mr.Mort”) . print(“Goodbye!”) .",
