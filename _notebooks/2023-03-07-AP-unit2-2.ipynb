    "\n",
    "A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee reconstruction of original data, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot. This is correct because lossless compression algorithms are guaranteed to be able to reconstruct the original data, while lossy compression algorithms are not.\n",

    "Compressing the file using a lossless compression algorithm before uploading it. This is correct because lossless compression algorithms allow for complete reconstruction of the original data and typically reduce the size of the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lossy compression of an image file generally provides a greater reduction in transmission time than lossless compression does.This is correct because since lossy data is unable to allow for complete reconstruction of the original data, that means less bits or packets(not sure of the exact term) are sent. Less data being transferred logically means that there is a reduction in transmission time.\n",
