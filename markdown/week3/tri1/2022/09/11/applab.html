<h2 id="program-purpose">
<a class="anchor" href="#program-purpose" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Program Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this quiz is to help me, and hopefully others, to remember Python Linux language. Throughout this trimester, I assume that we will a lot of content, and also forget some of the earlier content. Using active recall to review what you have learned can help you remember the content much easier.</p>

<h2 id="code-explaination">
<a class="anchor" href="#code-explaination" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code Explaination</h2>
<ol>
  <li>I defined and set a variable, score, to 0. This will be used to calculate the user’s end score out of 5 since I have 5 questions and each question will be worth 1 point.</li>
  <li>I set the screen to “homescreen”, this is where the game starts</li>
  <li>When the user clicks the “start quiz” button, the app takes them to the first question screen.</li>
  <li>For the first question the correct answer is Print Working Directory. Thus, if the user clicks Print Working Directory, 1 is added to the score variable. The next screen will say “You are correct! +1 points for you!” is shown and the screen takes 2 seconds to change to the next question. The screen then changes to the next question in 2 seconds.</li>
  <li>If another answer choice was chosen, then the next screen will say “You are incorrect! No points for you!” and no points will be added to the score</li>
  <li>The same process goes for all the other questions</li>
  <li>Once the user answers the fifth question, the screen is taken to the results screen. However, because the score for each user is different, I set the “score_result” text to the variable score that has been accumulating the user’s amount of correct answers.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="successes">
<a class="anchor" href="#successes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Successes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I was able to make the game easy to use so that the player won’t have difficulty understanding how to play the game</li>
  <li>The overall aesthetic of the game is pleasing to look at, nothing that will make the player feel uneasy when playing the game</li>
  <li>The game is user-friendly, there is a two second rest between questions and the words are easy to read</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="problems-and-their-solutions">
<a class="anchor" href="#problems-and-their-solutions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problems and their Solutions</h2>
<p>I have never used App Lab before, so in the beginning it was pretty frustrating to use since I wasn’t sure how everything worked.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I didn’t like how I had to block the same thing over and over again, but then I found out that I could use Copy and Paste when clicking on show text on the top right hand corner or the code section</li>
</ul>
